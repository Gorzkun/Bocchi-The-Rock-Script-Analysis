1;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Students;Talk;Come over now if you wanna play hide-and-seek! Me! I'll play! Me! I'll play!
2;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The girl who wonders, Would it be okay for me to join in? and so misses her chance, ending up all alone.
3;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Teacher Kinder;Talk;Hitori-chan, what's wrong?
4;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The girl who ends up all alone at a picnic, swapping parts of her lunch with the teacher.
5;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Teacher Picnic;Talk;Here you go.
6;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm home.
7;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm home. The girl who doesn't join any clubs, comes home right after school,
8;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;and finds her smartphone full of nothing but messages from her parents and coupon offers. That's me. Hitori Goto, first-year in middle school.
9;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;TV;Talk;And here, we'll stir-fry it a bit. There's a lot of vegetables, so you can probably make it quickly if you cut them in advance. You can probably do that in the morning, yeah. Lately I've gotten good at making so many dishes so quickly I thought I didn't need to know any more, but lately I'm learning once again how interesting cooking can be. Personally I like a lot of options with rice. Oh, of course. But you—
10;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sometimes I think I should really change the way I am... But I always stammer when I try to speak, and I'm really bad at keeping eye contact... A life as the archetypal introvert just seems to fit me best.
11;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Naoki Gotou;Talk;You watching this?
12;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Nah.
13;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Instorms Band Member;Talk;Back in school, I was the guy who sat in the back of the classroom pretending to read. No friends.
14;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Interviewer;Talk;And now you're part of a band that's extremely popular with young people!
15;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Instorms Band Member;Talk;Yeah. A band is a place where even introverts can shine.
16;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Interviewer;Talk;I see! Now, here's "Trigger" by Instorms!
17;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Naoki Gotou;Talk;What is it?
18;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;D-Dad, can I use your guitar?
19;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Sure!
20;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thanks!
21;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Aha! At last, Hitori's getting into guitar too!
22;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Maybe even someone like me can shine if I'm in a band! I've made up my mind. I'm gonna learn to play guitar! Then I'll form a band at school, and... E, A, G... What's with all the English? Then I'll play at the culture festival and have everyone go crazy for me! Crazy... for me?
23;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I practiced six hours every day, so I could learn how to play in front of people... The result? Middle school ended, and I never played a single note for them! I never performed once... At the culture festival! I never put together... The members for a band! And I never made a single friend... In three whole years! Now, in high school... I gotta form a band or die trying! But despite my vow, it's been a whole month since high school started, and yet my heart remains grounded in the guitar, little better than a shut-in... Lyrics and music by me. From the closet with love. But before I cause neighborhood problems playing my crummy original song late at night, I've gotta upload a cover I did of a popular band. It's been a pretty long time since I started uploading myself playing under the name "guitarhero" on my dad's advice, but... Wow, my latest video already has so many comments. I've been racking up the views lately, too, and people are telling me I'm good... Yeah, maybe it's okay if I can't handle real life! There are tons of people cheering for me online! The internet is filled with socially anxious introverts just like me! I put the effort in, okay? I brought CDs to school and set them on my desk. Talk to me! I bought band merch and showed it off. Talk to me!
24;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Speaker Voice;Talk;This next song is a request from Goto-san in Class 2-A.
25;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I put in song requests at lunch... ...for the death metal song I'd been obsessed with lately.
26;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Not the flashbacks! Begone! Begone, filthy memories! I wish I could perform live... That... That could work!
27;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I look... I look so cool! I'm already a total rocker chick! I look like a real somebody! The people can't look away! Someone's just gotta talk to me now! I'm gonna be all over this year's culture festival!
28;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Students;Talk;So you could see the corgi's butt... Do we move rooms next period? Science Room B. Hey, wanna karaoke after this? Great idea! You sure? Wonder what I should sing...
29;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Huh?
30;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Did I go overboard hyping myself up last night? But I'm putting out such powerful rocker chick vibes... D-Did I end up making myself unapproachable?! No, no, no! I'm having a mental breakdown!
31;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Kita's Friends;Talk;Wow, look at that!
32;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Thump
33;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Kita's Friends;Talk;At what?
34;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I-If they're laughing at me now, it won't just be a mental breakdown, it'll be mental annihilation!
35;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Kita's Friends;Talk;Aw, it's so cute, I've gotta laugh!
36;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Guitar?
37;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Kita's Friends;Talk;My day's immediately better! Right, Kita-chan? Kita-chan?
38;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Sorry, sorry! What was it?
39;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Look, I know. You can't put the onus on others and expect perfect results. This is a gathering place for people just as lonely as me. I bet that guy's separated from—
40;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Salaryman's Daughter;Talk;Papa!
41;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Salaryman's Wife;Talk;Sorry we're late!
42;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Salaryman;Talk;Hey, no problem. Now, let's grab dinner! What would you like?
43;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;They're the perfect freakin' family! Please forgive my presumptuous empathizing... Ah. I broke 30,000 subscribers. Hey, that's right. The online world is where I belong. Sorta makes me not wanna go back to school...
44;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Guitar! That's a guitar, right? Do you play?! Hello?
45;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I-I haven't talked to anyone in so long... my voice!
46;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, sorry to ambush you. I'm Nijika Ijichi, second-year at Shimo-Kitazawa High.
47;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Hitori Goto. Shuka High. First-year.
48;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So tell me, Hitori-chan...
49;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Right to first names, are we?!
50;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;How good are you at guitar?
51;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Pretty decent, I guess...
52;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Really?! Say, I'm in kind of a fix here... If you can't do it, that's okay, but... It's really okay, but I'm in a real fix...
53;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;There's nothing okay about her!
54;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, I'll come right out with it! Please, will you play second guitar for my band for today?!
55;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Band?
56;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We've got a concert coming up, and our guitarist just split! The song's not too hard! You'll pick it up right away!
57;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;A concert?! Right now?!
58;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Please! Please!
59;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um, err...
60;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Thanks! Let's head to the club!
61;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I haven't even said anything yet!
62;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I got dragged along.
63;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Do you come to Shimo-Kita a lot, Hitori-chan?
64;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, well...
65;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, well... Right, like I've got the courage to visit a fashion town for trendy people...
66;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We're almost to the club.
67;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Nijika-chan's fashionable, too. She's got the real rocker-chick vibe. Meanwhile, I'm in a potato-quality tracksuit with a real bear of a set of bags under my eyes, and a back as arched as a cat... Wait, do I also smell like mold? I spend so much time in the closet... No, I smell like mothballs. Meanwhile, Nijika-chan smells great! She smells just the way a high school girl should!
68;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, am I walking too fast?
69;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No...
70;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;The club we're gonna play at is called Starry. My big sister's the manager there.
71;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Playing at a club... That sounds weirdly legit. Wait, what's my heart doing?
72;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;And so... I've been working there part-time... Hitori-chan, are you actually pretty athletic?
73;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No, but I'm always the last one standing in dodgeball for some reason.
74;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I... I see.
75;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Me? Playing in a club? No, don't back down now! Remember your daydreams of performing at the culture festival! And your first solo show at Zepp Super Arena!
76;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Crowd;Imagination;Hitori! Hitori! Hitori!
77;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm the girl who sold out the Budokan...
78;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What?
79;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, nothing!
80;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, nothing! Please, don't let her think she made a mistake choosing me!
81;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Inner Voice;I might've made a mistake choosing her...
82;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I might've made a mistake choosing her... We're here! This is the place!
83;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-The dark lands?
84;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Good morning!
85;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;My first club... It's so dark... So stuffy... I-It's so soothing!
86;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You okay, Hitori-chan?
87;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm home!
88;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It is not! That's the band that's playing today. They might be a little older than us? After they're done, we'll rehearse too.
89;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I thought bands would be intimidating, but they're all indoorsy, shy introverts! They're just like me!
90;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That there's the PA.
91;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;PA-san;Talk;Good morning.
92;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Please forgive my arrogance!
93;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What's wrong now?!
94;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You're finally back.
95;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ryo! This is Hitori Goto. Hitori-chan! I met her in the park by miraculous happenstance! She's a guitarist!
96;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Oh?
97;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Scary! Is she glaring at me?
98;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;This is Ryo Yamada. She plays bass.
99;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I'm Hitori Goto! I'm so very sorry!
100;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hang on! Y-You're okay! Ryo's just not the expressive type. Feel free to call her weird! She likes it!
101;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I don't, actually.
102;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Seemed like she did...
103;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;By the way, about the manager... She told you to practice until it was time, but instead you snuck out of the club, so she got so mad she went out shopping.
104;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;N-No way! Let's be in the studio before she comes back! You too, Hitori-chan! C'mon!
105;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
106;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;R-Right! Real life is scary. But I feel like there's some fun stuff coming up!
107;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Here's today's set list and score.
108;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wh-Where are the other band members?
109;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;This is everyone! We'll be doing all instrumentals this time.
110;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Right. I can handle this song. Though without any vocals, the playing's gotta be all that much better... But I'm supposedly good at guitar. I can do this. I think I can do this!
111;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Inner Voice;Gorilla?
112;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Maybe they'll be blown away by my playing! I mean, I get pretty good... pretty decent reactions online. I even have 30,000 subscribers!
113;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's take it right from the top. It's your first time, so we'll run through slow, then we can speed it up as you get used to it. Okay, let's go!
114;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Yeah, let's do this!
115;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You suck!
116;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;H-How can I suck? I'm guitarhero! I've got 30,000 subscribers!
117;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ah, I'm kidding! Well, not totally kidding, but... Ah, I'm sorry!
118;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Guitar Man;Talk;Allow me to explain! In a band, it's super important to be in sync with your fellow live performers! But Hitori has social anxiety and can't make eye contact, and she'll be inclined to rush ahead of the others! She might be an awesome solo player, but when in a band, she's sub-water-flea level, the worst there is!
119;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Hello. I'm Plankton Goto.
120;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;She sounds like an unfunny comedian!
121;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;And thus, Hitori Goto turned to dust, and never picked up a guitar again.
122;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Come out, please! The show's about to start!
123;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I c-c-can't do it!
124;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's not your fault! We just came together today! It's not like I'm very good either.
125;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I'm very good.
126;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Just look at me, okay! Stay here in reality!
127;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It isn't like I could do the intro or anything... I-I could offer up my life to put on a harakiri show! Th-They'll at least remember the name of the band, right? Sorry I sucked!
128;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's a little too rock!
129;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's okay. If they boo you, I'll give them a bonk with my bass. Bonk.
130;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Does a bass make such a fancy noise?
131;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I mean, bloodshed is pretty rock.
132;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's rock.
133;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;You can't justify everything with "rock"!
134;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Besides, it'll probably just be my friends who come to watch us play!
135;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;And Nijika is my only friend, so...
136;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Normal high school girls don't know good music from bad.
137;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That kind of take could get you in trouble on the internet.
138;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay? So just chill!
139;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I d-dunno...
140;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I know good music from bad.
141;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well, you're not normal. Hey, that wasn't a compliment.
142;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Sorry.
143;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But...
144;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We can't force her.
145;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You're right. Sorry to push you so hard.
146;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;No, actually... I r-really was happy you reached out to me. I've wanted to be in a band for so long... B-But I couldn't get the people together... So I just upload covers to the internet instead.
147;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;What do you usually play?
148;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;M-Mostly songs by popular bands from the last few years, so I could play them right away once the band got together...
149;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's awesome!
150;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's not. It's the reason I'm the way I am now. Being in a band with other people was a pipe dream after all.
151;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Covering all popular songs? She sounds like guitarhero-san! Have you heard of her? She's probably about our age, I think...
152;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;guitarhero... M-Me?!
153;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'll send you a link if you haven't! She's super awesome! You should hear her!
154;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Awe... some?
155;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;She comes up in my recommendations a lot, so I've seen her too. She really is excellent.
156;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Right?! Though her naming sense is a bit cringy...
157;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It is?!
158;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I follow her with notifications on! I'd love to play with her some day!
159;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;You just did, actually...
160;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Look, what I'm getting at here is that even awesome, popular people are out there playing guitar, lots and lots of them, in places we're not even watching. You should watch her later! I think you'll get what I mean if you watch the videos.
161;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I always figured real-life people didn't care about me at all...
162;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You can't give up on playing in a band just because it didn't work out today! It's possible it's our problem, anyway...
163;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Our problem?
164;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hitori-chan?
165;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;But someone this nice has been watching me all this time, and actually spoke to me... It's the kind of miracle most people never experience! I can't let it go to waste!
166;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;She stood up.
167;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... I'm...
168;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;D-Do you want to perform after all? Hitori-chan?
169;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I know all that, rationally... But I'm still too scared... There's no way I can play in front of an audience...
170;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;If you're scared, you could play from in here.
171;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-It's the same environment that I play in all the time!
172;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Where exactly do you live?
173;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;How you feelin' tonight, Shimo-Kita?!
174;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;She's suddenly more outgoing.
175;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;By the way, how do you want us to introduce you? Hitori-chan? Should we use your real name?
176;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'd... I'd rather not...
177;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Any nicknames, then?
178;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;In middle school, they called me Hey and "You there"...
179;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I don't think those are nicknames!
180;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I never knew anyone well enough to get nicknames from them!
181;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Hitori... Hitoribocchi (all alone)... How about Bocchi-chan?
182;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Another tactless comment!
183;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm B-B-Bocchi!
184;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;She likes it?
185;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's just my first ever nickname...
186;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;This is making me teary-eyed.
187;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, you haven't told me your band name yet.
188;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's Kessoku Band.
189;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Kessoku Band... Isn't that the word for "zip tie"?
190;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's brilliant.
191;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's the worst pun! We're totally changing it!
192;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Why? It's cute.
193;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes.
194;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Band name aside, it's time to play! Don't worry. The key is to have fun, even if you suck! Your feelings really come out in your playing, see?
195;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right...
196;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We can always work on the skill part next time.
197;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah.
198;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Next... time...
199;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, let's go!
200;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Right.
201;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;They're okay with there being a next time!
202;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nice to meet you! We're Kessoku Band! We'll play a bunch of songs you probably know, so please enjoy!
203;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Who's that?
204;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I hate that I can't play as well as I usually do, but... playing in a band with other people is so much fun! I've never really shone before today... And I still don't! This might actually be a low point for me!
205;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Boy, I screwed up!
206;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Your intro bombed, too.
207;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;E-Excuse me! B-B-B...
208;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What?
209;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-B-B-B-B...
210;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, you're freaking me out!
211;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-Before our next performance, I'm gonna get brave enough to say hello to my classmates!
212;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;What a dramatic declaration. Such growth...
213;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, I get it. Sure! Then let's have a Bocchi-chan-welcome-party- slash-concert-post-mortem!
214;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Actually, I'm pretty exhausted from all this social interaction, so I'm gonna go.
215;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sorry. I'm sleepy.
216;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Talk;P-Pardon me!
217;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;There's no "ties" in this band at all!
218;1;1;Lonely Rolling Bocchi;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm gonna get over my social anxiety and bring out my full guitarhero powers! For Nijika-chan, Ryo-san, and Kessoku Band! S-Sorry! Sorry!
219;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Twenty more minutes... Twenty more minutes... Twenty more minutes... Twenty more minutes... Twenty more minutes...
220;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Yesterday, Nijika-chan said...
221;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Message;Hi there! Thanks for everything today! You seriously saved our butts, Bocchi-chan Let's have a talk about our future as a band! Meetup at Starry tomorrow, okay?
222;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The joy of getting LOINE messages from someone who wasn't a relative got me this far, but... If I walk in there looking like the hick I am, they'll all look at me like I don't belong there... I made it in last time because I was with Nijika-chan, but... I wonder if anyone's there? I wish I had someone to go in with. Five minutes. I'll wait five minutes, then go in. No, ten... Fifteen. I'll totally go in after fifteen.
223;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What's she doing? Bo—
224;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Wait. I wanna watch a little longer.
225;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Could you please stop enjoying this?
226;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay! I hereby declare the first Kessoku Band members' meeting... open! Round of applause! Clappy clappy clap clap clap! Now, let's see... Oh, wait. We barely know each other, so I dunno what to talk about!
227;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She just admitted it!
228;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I brought this for just such an occasion.
229;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nice one!
230;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I don't think I like the looks of this...
231;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;There! What'll she roll? What'll she roll?
232;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun...
233;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Talk about School TAS for short!
234;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Proceed.
235;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um... Wait, don't you both go to the same school...
236;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, Shima High!
237;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We chose it 'cause it's close to home.
238;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, so you live in Shimo-Kitazawa...
239;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Huh? Bocchi-chan, don't you go to Shuka High? Shouldn't you live around here too?
240;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;No, I live out-of-prefecture. Two-hour commute each way.
241;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Two hours?!
242;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Why?
243;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I wanted a high school where nobody knew my past.
244;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, enough TAS!
245;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sorry... I spend most of my time at school alone, so I don't have any f-fun stories to contribute...
246;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, it's okay! Ryo doesn't have many friends either.
247;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah, just Nijika.
248;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Tha-thump. Ryo-san is just like me...
249;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;On days off, she does urban exploration and visits second-hand clothing shops...
250;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;No, she's not... Ryo-san likes being alone! Someone with social anxiety could never enter a clothing shop on her own! The gap between the lonely and the loner is too deep and vast to ever be traversed! I nearly fell into the trap.
251;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, let's enjoy the conversation!
252;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Next up, we'll talk about our favorite music! For short...
253;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;TAFM!
254;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;T-TAFM...
255;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I like Japanese punk, like mellow core.
256;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I like techno kayo, and lately I've been checking the Saudi Arabian charts—
257;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;True stuff only, please!
258;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;That is true.
259;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan?
260;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, um... I like any songs that don't trigger my seishun complex.
261;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Seishun complex?
262;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Guitar man;Talk;Allow me to explain! Songs that trigger Hitori's seishun complex are glitter-coated upbeat songs that include words like summer, "blue sea," fireworks, "puppy love," and other things irrelevant to her personal school experience!
263;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Such words plunge me into a deep melancholy.
264;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, Bocchi-chan?
265;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Guitar man;Talk;By the same token, you love bands that write about the bleakness of their high school years, right?
266;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey...
267;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, yeah! But sometimes I find out a band I love was super popular in school, and they suddenly feel like strangers to me...
268;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, please! Come back to our planet, please!
269;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Rock resonates as the music of the perpetual underdog. Is it really rock if it's sung by life's winners?
270;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm trying to establish some ties, here!
271;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Since we're named after zip ties.
272;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Um... Our first concert was instrumentals only, but I'd like to have vocals next time.
273;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, do you?
274;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;The guitarist who ran off was gonna be our singer, but... Where'd she even go, anyway?
275;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The runaway guitarist... Maybe she's socially anxious like me. No, there's no way! If you're really socially anxious, you can't even run away!
276;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We've gotta find a new vocalist. I can't sing for squat, myself. Bocchi-chan, can you— Yeah... Figured.
277;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um... Wh-What about Ryo-san?
278;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;If I were to serve as frontman, I'd overwhelm the band and crush it.
279;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Where do you get that wellspring of confidence?
280;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm so jealous. I'd like a little of that confidence for myself...
281;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I know! Let's find a vocalist and write a song! Ryo can write the music, and if you've got off-limits words, Bocchi-chan, you should write the lyrics!
282;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Me?!
283;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well? Great idea, huh?
284;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The nine years of lunch breaks I spent in school libraries... Was it all in preparation for this moment?
285;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;So, what will you do, Nijika?
286;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Go! Next, talk about quotas!
287;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Just shamelessly dodged that one, eh?
288;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um... What are quotas?
289;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;The concert we did yesterday is called a "booked concert." It's where the club assigns the band a ticket quota to make sure enough people come. Your quota is ten tickets! Anything sold over the quota gets split between the club and the band... But if they can't bring in enough to meet the quota, the band has to pay the rest out of pocket.
290;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;So until you get popular, it's a money pit.
291;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That's very concise!
292;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;A bunch of my friends came to yesterday's concert, so we managed to meet our quota, but...
293;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;After that performance, they likely won't be back.
294;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You said it! And Ryo's got no friends, so she'll be no help... Bocchi-chan, do you— Oh, sorry! Forget what I said. Just please lose the dead fish stare!
295;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I've got plenty of imaginary friends, but...
296;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Guitar man;Talk;You rock, Hitori-chan!
297;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Microphone man;Talk;Living national treasure!
298;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Anyway, since we'll need tens of thousands of yen before our next concert, let's get jobs to cover the quota and equipment!
299;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Okay. Jobs?!
300;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's the loudest I've ever heard you.
301;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;No. I don't want to work. Too scary! Society is too scary!
302;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;A piggy bank?
303;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;M-My mom was saving up for my wedding... But you can have it. Just... Please, no job...
304;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Don't make us the bad guys here!
305;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Thanks, we'll take good care of—
306;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We're not taking it! We can't take money that means that much to you!
307;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;But...
308;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;But... I don't wanna work! Because... W-Welcome... Sh-Should I warm... up? It'd totally be like that... And then that...
309;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Imaginary Prosecutor;Imagination;For the crime of creeping out the customers, we seek the death penalty!
310;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Imaginary Judge;Imagination;Okay, here comes the ruling... Death!
311;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;And then that!
312;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;...cchi-chan. Bocchi-chan. Bocchi-chan! You weren't listening, were you?
313;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sorry! Wh-What were you saying?
314;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You should work here with us.
315;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Here? What?!
316;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You won't have to be scared if you're with me and Ryo!
317;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's a homey and harmonious place to work.
318;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We can serve drinks, and clean, and see all kinds of bands!
319;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Don't wanna work... Don't wanna work...
320;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well? What do you think?
321;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Say no, girl! Say no! You have to say no!
322;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Say no, girl! Say no! You have to say no! I'll dwu mwy bwest...
323;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Really? Thanks so much!
324;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sorry, girl...
325;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;The job'll be more fun if we're all together!
326;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It wouldn't be social anxiety if we had the courage to say no.
327;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'll manage the band's funds, then.
328;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um... Wouldn't it be better to have Ryo-san do that?
329;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What's that supposed to mean?! Listen, Bocchi-chan. Believe it or not, Ryo's a very irresponsible spender. Her family's rich and she gets a huge allowance, but she blows it all on instruments, so she's constantly broke!
330;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Blush.
331;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What part of that did you take as a compliment? Anyway, let's work hard so we can play live again soon! Then we'll make our major debut in high school!
332;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We start work next week! Come straight here after school!
333;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Bocchi. Bye-bye.
334;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;R-Right...
335;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;And that first day of work is tomorrow. I've been in here for thirty minutes now. I'm bound to catch a cold, right? I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'll work hard at everything except the job.
336;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Futari Gotou;Talk;Mom! Sis is drowning!
337;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Catch a cold! Catch a cold! Catch a cold! Catch a cold! Catch a cold!
338;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Curse this good health of mine... Then I'll just have to fake— Nijika-chan?
339;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Message;Morning! First day of work, right? I know you're nervous, but we'll be there for you! Let's work hard together!
340;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;No fair being so nice while I'm trying to blow off work...
341;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Message;No fair being so nice while I'm trying to blow off work... You've made me realize the foolish error of my ways. For making an honest woman out of me, you have my boundless gratitude.
342;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What is she talking about?
343;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm here. Do it, Bocchi! Do it, Bocchi! Do it, Bocchi! Do it, Bocchi!
344;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Tickets don't go on sale until five o'clock. We're still getting ready here.
345;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She works here?! She thinks I'm up to no good... I've got to clear this up!
346;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;She works here?! She thinks I'm up to no good... I've got to clear this up! C-C-C-C-C-Calm down...
347;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You're the one who needs to calm down.
348;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;So you're the new part-timer? You should've just said so.
349;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-S-S-S-Sorry!
350;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I'm the manager here. Nice to meet you.
351;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;V-Very nice to meet you...
352;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;V-Very nice to meet you... The manager's scary. I can't handle people like her. Nijika-chan, come here quick!
353;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, you're the guitarist who played in the box. Wasn't it... Mango Kamen?
354;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;A new nickname? I like you, Manager!
355;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A new nickname? I like you, Manager! I-I'm Mango Kamen!
356;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That is not her name! Don't go giving her weird nicknames, Sis!
357;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Sis?! You're Nijika-chan's sister?
358;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I told you before. When you first came to Starry, remember? The club we're gonna play at is called Starry. My big sister's the manager there. Actually, our family lives in the apartments above it.
359;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;My heart was pounding so loud that I didn't hear her.
360;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;My heart was pounding so loud that I didn't hear her. R-R-R-Really?
361;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That means you don't have to be so nervous. Right, Sis?
362;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Call me "Manager" here. And keep our work and private relationships separate.
363;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Don't scare her like that!
364;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, let's clear the tables first. When that's done, we'll wipe them all down... Huh? Where's Bocchi-chan?
365;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Sorry. I needed a breather in a dark, cramped place.
366;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You need a breather already?!
367;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Here, Bocchi-chan, come over and learn the drinks. Tonic water comes out of here, and beer comes out of this dispenser. The cocktails are on the shelf behind...
368;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I'll never remember it all! Too fast! I just... mummummmmm... I'll have to infuse the knowledge into me through song!
369;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Where did that come from?!
370;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Cocktails are in the rightmost shelf!
371;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You're scaring me!
372;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Tequila! Vodka! Kahlua! Rum!
373;1;2;See You Tomorrow;PA-san;Talk;They seem fun.
374;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm glad you're learning the drinks, but why don't you set the guitar down? Hey, are you listening? You're not, are you?! You're seriously scaring me! P-Please! Come back to us! Hitori-chan! Hitori-chan!
375;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Weird... She seemed kind of crappy at the concert, but...
376;1;2;See You Tomorrow;PA-san;Talk;She's good.
377;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Inner Voice;Nijika's trying so hard to stop her, I don't think she realizes it... But I recognize that sound from somewhere.
378;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Nijika's trying so hard to stop her, I don't think she realizes it... But I recognize that sound from somewhere. Get to work!
379;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Why me?!
380;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;For drink service, just pour the drinks they order and hand them over.
381;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right...
382;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;They can pay 500 yen on top of the ticket price to get a drink ticket.
383;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;500 yen per drink? And why a drink ticket system?
384;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Stop staring like it's totally alien to you. Clubs like this are actually considered restaurants. I don't know all the details, but apparently it's super hard to get a business license to run just a concert venue.
385;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... I see!
386;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So we offer drinks and operate like a restaurant. Are you listening?
387;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;W-Working at a restaurant is advanced stuff! I can't believe I cleared that bar so soon! Is this... personal growth?!
388;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, customers already! We're about to be busy, Bocchi-chan!
389;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What? Wait... Customer service already?! What do I say?! Thank you for your royal parentage... That's not it! J-Just give me a practice run, please! N-No, wait! Stop it!
390;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;What? Wait... Customer service already?! What do I say?! Thank you for your royal parentage... That's not it! J-Just give me a practice run, please! N-No, wait! Stop it! Thanks for coming!
391;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;She closed up!
392;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Starry's Customer;Talk;Excuse me! One cola, please!
393;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Coming! Bocchi-chan, cola!
394;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Coming up!
395;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Starry's Customer;Talk;I'll have a ginger ale.
396;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Coming up!
397;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, show some respect for the customers!
398;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-B-But I'm not ready!
399;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We're losing the club's inherent darkness.
400;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;One oolong and one highball!
401;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Starry's Customer;Talk;Where's the bathroom?
402;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Down the hall to your right, door on the left!
403;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I experienced no personal growth whatsoever.
404;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, look!
405;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Starry's Customer;Talk;Here they are!
406;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Alexandism Member;Talk;Hey, there! We're Alexandism! Our second album goes on sale today, so we're back to doing concerts, but we hope you all bought it! Thanks! We tried to make every single song better than our first album, and if you haven't bought it yet, we're about to play some of those songs, so if you like them, please buy the album! And there's something I want to tell you guys first. The crowd rocked pretty hard at our last concert! So after it was over, a guy came up and offered up his card. And we were so nervous. "Is this time for our major debut?" we thought. But it would look pretty lame to let it show, so after a beat we just said, Hello, welcome. Welcome? Habits can be scary, huh? The words that came out of my mouth were the words I've said a million times at my part time job. According to the guy who gave us his card, he wanted to listen to the band on after us today, Tidaman, but we don't get along with them, and we really wanna outshine them, so we hope you listen to Alexandism too! Now, let me introduce the band! Always eating curry before a concert, with his own way of doing things... on bass, Matsuda! And the normal guy who always has our backs... on drums, Rei! He's got so many effects pedals he barely has room on stage to stand... on guitar, Koichi! And on guitar and vocals, without much to recommend him... me! Tsuyoshi! Let's do this!
407;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;They're pretty good, y'know? It's a good time to relax. Once the performances start, we'll have time to kill.
408;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Right...
409;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Good work.
410;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Good work! Don't you have to sell tickets?
411;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Manager stepped in for me. All of today's bands are really popular, so she told me to watch and learn.
412;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's my sister for you. She's a tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun-tsun... ...dere. You know?
413;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Excessive tsun.
414;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-S-Sorry... Not only did I fail to help you, I couldn't even make eye contact with the customers.
415;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Want this? Sorry it's not for mangos.
416;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No, thank you. You're doing fine! It's your first day. You'll get used to it!
417;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wh-Why are you so nice to a sub-water-flea like me?
418;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You know... I really like this club. But here and reception are the only places club staff interact with the customers, so I want to do my best to make other people like it, too.
419;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm s-s-sorry. I w-worked so badly at a place that means so much to you...
420;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No, no. That's not what I meant. I meant I want you to like this club too, Bocchi-chan. I want us to have fun working, and to have fun playing. Together. 'Course, I also hope you'll be able to speak to customers with a smile some day, too... It's starting, Bocchi-chan!
421;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The whole place is united. The customers and the performers are all enjoying themselves. Meanwhile, at my concert... The customers paid 2,000 yen to see that, didn't they? If I stay the way I am, I'm gonna give them the same listless concert next time too, aren't I? I want to make the effort to change, even if only gradually, and enjoy it with the rest of them.
422;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Starry's Customer;Talk;Excuse me! Orange juice.
423;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Coming up...
424;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;C-Coming up... Look the customer in the eye. Interact. Smile! Look her in the eye! Interact!
425;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Coming up... Look the customer in the eye. Interact. Smile! Look her in the eye! Interact! H-Here you are.
426;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! Your eyes! Your eyes!
427;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Starry's Customer;Talk;Thanks!
428;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Wow, that was nerve-wracking! But great job! You kept your head above the counter and talked to her!
429;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I did my best!
430;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah! Having you here will make my memories of today's concert even more fun. And you've taken a step forward.
431;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A step...
432;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;A step... A step. A step?! It feels like I took a thousand, though!
433;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Good work today. Take care getting home.
434;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Bye-bye.
435;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you for having me.
436;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Not leaving, Ryo?
437;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Staying a little while first.
438;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan!
439;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes?!
440;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;See you later!
441;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes, s-s-s-see you tomorrow!
442;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's over! I made it through an entire day somehow! This work thing isn't as hard as I thought it would be! I'll do my best again tomorrow!
443;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's over! I made it through an entire day somehow! This work thing isn't as hard as I thought it would be! I'll do my best again tomorrow! Achoo! Eh?
444;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Bocchi worked hard, huh?
445;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah. And she managed to say "see you tomorrow!"
446;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah.
447;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm glad we formed this band. Oh, right! Let's send a LOINE message to Bocchi-chan. I'll say, "Let's keep it up tomorrow!"
448;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;She's got an awful fever. Dear, prepare a cold compress, would you?
449;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Does she need a trip to the hospital?
450;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;N-Now I get the fever...
451;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Now that we've got Bocchi-chan on board... All that's left... is to find a new vocalist!
452;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Kita's Friends;Talk;Who's this one for?
453;1;2;See You Tomorrow;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Me, me! It's me, it's me!
454;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A melancholy Monday has arrived.
455;1;3;Be Right There;Futari Gotou;Talk;Feels good to be over your cold, huh?
456;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah...
457;1;3;Be Right There;Futari Gotou;Talk;Or are you happy your cold let you miss school a few days?
458;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Not at all.
459;1;3;Be Right There;Futari Gotou;Talk;How come? You always say you wanna stay home...
460;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I don't like going to school, but for someone like me, even one day of failing to attend class puts me in risk of being forgotten by my classmates.
461;1;3;Be Right There;Futari Gotou;Talk;Guess you're a real pain in your own ass, Sis! Oh, and Mom says it's time to eat!
462;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Yes, it's true. I could burst from the sheer volume of nuisance I inflict upon myself. But wait a minute. I joined a band, and I'm working part-time at a club! Perhaps I've graduated from my introversion! Yes! I'll take my guitar to school again. Someone's bound to talk to me this time!
463;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Yep. Putting the onus on others fails once again.
464;1;3;Be Right There;Students;Talk;Hey, did you watch the latest Oto-Station? I did did! You can stream BAKWIMPS again! I've been listening to them so much since yesterday, they're still playing in my head! Uh-oh!
465;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Band talk!
466;1;3;Be Right There;Students;Talk;What's up, Gotoh-san? You hardly ever talk to anyone!
467;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;All my preparation assumed others would approach me first, so I don't know how to start a conversation...
468;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;All my preparation assumed others would approach me first, so I don't know how to start a conversation... I forgot.
469;1;3;Be Right There;Students;Talk;In that short a time?!
470;1;3;Be Right There;Guitar man;Talk;It's lunchtime!
471;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;This is for the best. If I'd managed to talk to them, right about now...
472;1;3;Be Right There;Imaginary Students;Imagination;Barging into our convo like that... Was she listening in the whole time or something?! I didn't know she was such a creep!
473;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That's definitely how it'd be! I'll never rise above my station again. I'll live under the radar forever! Thank you for the meal. Still... A quiet place like this is just perfect for lunch. I'm glad I found a nice spot. It's awkward eating all alone in the classroom. And once I become a popular guitarist, I'll go on Oto-Station and say... What were you like in high school? I didn't have any friends back then. I often ate lunch in a dark corner filled with desks and janitorial supplies. I can awe people with how much I've changed! Y'know how it is...
474;1;3;Be Right There;Kita's Friends;Talk;Karaoke was so much fun the other day!
475;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;People!
476;1;3;Be Right There;Kita's Friends;Talk;Kita-chan's such a great singer. I heard she played guitar in a band before she quit. Wow! Now that's musical talent!
477;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Band? Come to think of it, Nijika-chan was talking about wanting a new guitar-slash-vocalist... Since my cold kept me from working for a few days, I must find a guitar-slash-vocalist to prove my commitment to Kessoku Band! But the thought of going up to a total stranger...
478;1;3;Be Right There;Kita's Friends;Talk;Kita-chan! Heya! I'm super sorry, but I have a huge favor to ask...
479;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What kind of girl is she?
480;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What is it?
481;1;3;Be Right There;Kita's Friends;Talk;Would you mind pitching in at our basketball game next week?
482;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She's pretty!
483;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, sure thing!
484;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She's super nice!
485;1;3;Be Right There;Kita's Friends;Talk;Maybe I'll land a three-pointer!
486;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She's pretty, and athletic, and popular,
487;1;3;Be Right There;Kita's Friends;Talk;Awesome! Thanks!
488;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;and she plays the guitar... I'm supposed to issue an invitation to someone like her?! In fact, my identity... My entire identity is crumbling!
489;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What was that sound?
490;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I worked up the courage to arrive at her classroom, but my mental fortitude lags behind...
491;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You're Gotoh-san from Class 2, right?
492;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She knows my n—
493;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Are you looking for someone in here?
494;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;S-Say it, Hitori! My band is looking for a guitar-slash- vocalist. Would you be interested?"
495;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Say it, Hitori! My band is looking for a guitar-slash- vocalist. Would you be interested?" Ba! Gui! Vo!
496;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;She became a human beatbox! Er... Bam-chika-boom-chika... bam-chika-boom-chika...
497;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... I'm so sorry!
498;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;W-Wait!
499;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Two more additions to my dark past in one day. Lend me your ears. This is my new song: Double Dark Past, Bocchi Acoustic Version. Melancholy days, multiplying traumas Wanna ditch this negative legacy I carry... The memories bring soft, secret tears to my eyes Mourning my past, so many dark mornings Wishing, someday, to just laugh it all away...
500;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Two more additions to my dark past in one day. Lend me your ears. This is my new song: Double Dark Past, Bocchi Acoustic Version. Melancholy days, multiplying traumas Wanna ditch this negative legacy I carry... The memories bring soft, secret tears to my eyes Mourning my past, so many dark mornings Wishing, someday, to just laugh it all away... Begone, memories...
501;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That was awesome!
502;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;K-Kita-san?! How long have you...
503;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I got so worried when you ran off like that, but that was incredible! You're amazing at guitar, Gotoh-san! That song you were playing had me totally enraptured!
504;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She's saying nice things about me! What a nice person!
505;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Are you in a band?
506;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;K-Kind of...
507;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, can you play other stuff? I wanna hear!
508;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The extrovert aura... It's so powerful, I can't look straight at her!
509;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, and you were trying to talk to someone earlier, right?
510;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-This is my chance to invite her!
511;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-This is my chance to invite her! W-Well, our band is actually looking for a guitar-slash-vocalist, and I heard you played guitar, so...
512;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, so that's why.
513;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Huh?
514;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm sorry, Gotoh-san. I can't join your band.
515;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;O-Oh, but... I'm kind of a nerd, but the others are cool!
516;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, it's not a problem with you or anything.
517;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;They're holding a barbecue next weekend! They host a sports meet every six months! They party in limousines after every gig! They do so much cool stuff!
518;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I don't want a band that parties that hard...
519;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;And... And...
520;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;The truth is, I can't actually play guitar at all. I was in another band not long ago. I lied when I joined because I wanted to get close to my senpai. But the whole thing was just beyond me, so I ran away.
521;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Beyond you?
522;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah. There's more to playing than just this strum-strum stuff, right? I'd figured this wooden stick part was just for decoration! It's way too hard for someone to learn on their own. Major chords? "Minor"? What is this, baseball?
523;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Her non-comprehension is on a whole other level!
524;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Did someone teach you to play, Gotoh-san?
525;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No, I mostly taught myself...
526;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What?! Really? That's awesome!
527;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's not that great...
528;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I know! Will you teach me to play, Gotoh-san? You can be my teacher! You're so brilliant, I just know you'll get me through it!
529;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, shucks...
530;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I want to learn to play properly, go back to my old band, and apologize! So, when can you teach me? After class, maybe?
531;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I've got a job at a club after class...
532;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Then after work, maybe?! Is there a studio next door? We can do it there!
533;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh... Oh... V-Very well.
534;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Really? Thanks!
535;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Why am I so stupid?! Say no, girl!
536;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Can we start right away?
537;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Certainly...
538;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;C-Certainly... Crap, crap, crap, crap, crap! I've gotta get the girls to act like party people!
539;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's from Bocchi-chan.
540;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Message;I'm sorry! Please come to work today blaring EDM and dancing around with energy drinks on hand!
541;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What in the world?
542;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Beats me.
543;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh... You work in Shimo-Kitazawa?
544;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You've been?
545;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;My last band was in Shimo-Kita, and its members lived in the area, so...
546;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Really?
547;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hang on! You can't walk behind me! I don't know the way!
548;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm sorry. I'm still not used to being here... I'm so embarrassed!
549;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm the one embarrassed here!
550;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;W-We're almost there. It's a place called Starry. Nijika-chan and Ryo-san will already be there...
551;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm sorry. I can't go.
552;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;How come?
553;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm sorry. I can't tell you why, but that's the one place I can't go! And you can never tell those people I was h—
554;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! Your instructions were super weird, but I bought energy drinks like you asked! The runaway guitarist!
555;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Runaway... guitarist?
556;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, what are you doing here?
557;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;W-W-Well, I...
558;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Eh?
559;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Forgive my prior discourtesy! I'll do anything to make up for it! I give you permission to rough me up good!
560;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Shh! You're gonna give people the wrong idea!
561;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What? So you couldn't play guitar, Kita-chan?
562;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Nope.
563;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;And that's why you always ditched practice?
564;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah...
565;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Poor Kita-san seems so uncomfortable... I-If only I could think of something nice to say.
566;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We were worried when we didn't hear from you.
567;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Ryo-san, so smooth!
568;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Senpai!
569;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I assumed you were dead, so I've been lighting incense for you every day.
570;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's a pretty wild assumption...
571;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Um... You aren't angry?
572;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I sorta blame ourselves for not catching on sooner. Besides... We managed to work it out anyway!
573;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;S-Still, I feel too awful! Please, let me make it up to you!
574;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm not sure how...
575;1;3;Be Right There;Seika Ijichi;Talk;How about you help out today at the club? It's gonna be a busy night.
576;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Th-That can't be enough...
577;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No, that'd be a huge help! Please join us!
578;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;If you'd like...
579;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm so glad they worked it out...
580;1;3;Be Right There;Seika Ijichi;Talk;So, go over there and get changed.
581;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Changed?
582;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Why does Manager have that outfit?
583;1;3;Be Right There;Seika Ijichi;Talk;She's pretty darn good for a fill-in worker.
584;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, Kita-chan knows what she's doing!
585;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She really does!
586;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;She'll give me extra time to slack off.
587;1;3;Be Right There;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I'll take it out of your pay.
588;1;3;Be Right There;PA-san;Talk;You smell good, Kita-san.
589;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thank you so much! Maybe it's the shampoo? It's my favorite!
590;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She's never said my name before!
591;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You're pretty outgoing, Kita-chan. Wanna try reception? I'll teach you!
592;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay!
593;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;And the job they've never trusted me with!
594;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;500 yen for a drink ticket! What band did you come to see today? Take a flyer, if you like!
595;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Say, not bad at all!
596;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I love interacting with people!
597;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ryo always handles reception, but her dead eyes are kind of a problem... And her poker face can be scary.
598;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ryo-senpai looks fine just the way she is!
599;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Bocchi. What are you doing down there?
600;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Losing my identity. Now, lend me your ears. This is... The Elegy of the Part-Time Worker Who Lost Her Identity to the Just-Arrived Newbie."
601;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Losing my identity. Now, lend me your ears. This is... The Elegy of the Part-Time Worker Who Lost Her Identity to the Just-Arrived Newbie." Thanks for watching, everyone! We haven't known each other long, but I enjoyed the precious time we spent together.
602;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! Bocchi-chan! Teach Kita-chan how to do the drinks!
603;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
604;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;R-Right! Now's my chance to restore my good name! I can't do it! I get nervous when I'm being watched!
605;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You okay? I think I get the idea, so you can rest a while.
606;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Please forgive my arrogance...
607;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm just glad you weren't seriously hurt.
608;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank yo...
609;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-Thank yo... What? Her fingertips...
610;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, what made you want to join a band?
611;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's an indoor activity where you can be flashy and cool... And I wanna be popular... My motives are excessively impure!
612;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's an indoor activity where you can be flashy and cool... And I wanna be popular... My motives are excessively impure! W-World peace... I want to work toward world peace.
613;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;How conscientious!
614;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Here's your cola!
615;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um, so the senpai you wanted to get closer to...
616;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah. It's Ryo-senpai.
617;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Here ya go.
618;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Unlike you, I have very impure motives. I saw Senpai playing on the street, and fell head-over-heels for her.
619;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Ryo-san was in another band, too?
620;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Her above-it-all attitude, her unisex look... It all makes me squee!
621;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Squee?
622;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;And she just looks so right holding an instrument!
623;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, I know what you mean! Wh-When I hold mine, it looks more like the instrument's holding me.
624;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Right? You end up like an appendage to the instrument. I wonder how that happens?
625;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's like we're best buddies all of a sudden...
626;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That's one thing about Ryo-senpai that—
627;1;3;Be Right There;Starry's Customer;Talk;Um, can I get a cassis orange?
628;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Right! Coming right up!
629;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Bye-bye, buddies! I'll know my place next time...
630;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;After I heard her play, I followed Ryo-san's activities for a while, and she dropped out of her last band pretty suddenly.
631;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Huh...
632;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Then I found out she was recruiting for Kessoku Band, and without thinking, I said I'd do it.
633;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;S-Such initiative! Extroversion abounds!
634;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;A band is like your second family, you know?
635;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Family?
636;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah, you spend more time with them than with your actual family, and you're all chasing the same dream... It's a mysterious relationship, closer than friends or significant others. I've never done clubs or anything similar, so I've always wanted to be part of that.
637;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I get you. I always wanted it too...
638;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yes... I wanted to join Kessoku Band and become Senpai's girl! So much deeper and more intimate than friendship!
639;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Wait. Is Kita-san kind of not-okay?
640;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But that's all the more reason I can't join the band now. I flaked out once already. I'm too irresponsible. I don't deserve to be in the band.
641;1;3;Be Right There;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, good work, all. Feel free to head home.
642;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Thank you for having us...
643;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thanks for everything today. Good luck with your band! I'll keep rooting for you! Goodbye!
644;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Hey...
645;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan?!
646;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Are you all right, Gotoh-san? You're not still worried about me, are you? I'm sorry. Like I said before, I can't join Kessoku Band. I can't play guitar, and I already flaked out once...
647;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... I... I... I also ran away before the concert. I hid in a trash can, and... A-A-And also...
648;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's get you up, Bocchi-chan. One, two... Here we go!
649;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;K-Kita-san, your left hand... Y-You had calluses on your fingertips. I... I th-think...
650;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You'd have to be practicing the guitar pretty hard for that.
651;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah!
652;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, we'd love to have you rocking out with us in Kessoku Band!
653;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Why would you let me...
654;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Because if you hadn't flaked out, we'd never have met Bocchi-chan!
655;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah!
656;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I've always wanted to have a band, so I get how it feels intimidating and aspirational at the same time.
657;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-So do I! S-Sorry. That came out louder than I expected.
658;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You'd be happy to have her too, right, Ryo?
659;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I'll only have to pay one-quarter of the studio and quota fees.
660;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Be a little less honest, would you?
661;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I can be part of Senpai's quota!
662;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So much for that healthy moving-on thing, I guess...
663;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But I still can't play the guitar...
664;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's okay! Bocchi-chan will teach you!
665;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Eh?
666;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah, yeah.
667;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Ehh?
668;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You will?
669;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes!
670;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Y-Yes! I can't exactly turn her down now!
671;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thank you. I'll work really hard to play guitar in Kessoku Band! Oh, but you should probably give up that party lifestyle of yours... You're dancing like mad every night, right?
672;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Where'd you hear that?!
673;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm glad it's all mended. It came out like a mess, but I'm glad I stopped Kita-san from leaving. I worked really hard!
674;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Well, I gotta head out now...
675;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, don't go! You're today's MVP!
676;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You're the reason we're back together.
677;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thank you, Gotoh-san!
678;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Gosh, well, it was nothing, really, honestly...
679;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It obviously wasn't nothing for you.
680;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san wears her heart on her sleeve.
681;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But I practiced for so long, and yet I never really learned how to play guitar. It just made this quiet 'bum-bum' sound.
682;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You're sure it wasn't a bass?
683;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, I'm not that ignorant! A bass has four strings, right? See? It's got the full six strings!
684;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Some do have six strings...
685;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;That's a six-string bass.
686;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;K-Kita-san!
687;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It cost me two years' advance allowance from my dad, not to mention my New Year's money...
688;1;3;Be Right There;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan!
689;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;And so, Kessoku Band officially had all their members.
690;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;No more! I hereby quit the guitar!
691;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What? Are we breaking up already?
692;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Is this one defective too? Did I get another bass?
693;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No, that's definitely a guitar...
694;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm sorry I whine so much. I know you're giving up your time after class and during lunch to teach me...
695;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Hey, it's not...
696;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;With Ryo-senpai lending me this guitar, and everyone helping... I have to do my best.
697;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-But I really am glad... that Ryo-san b-bought that bass off of you...
698;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah. But when she gave me the money...
699;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;This is the last of my money, so I'll be eating weeds from now on.
700;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That was a joke, right?
701;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She might have been serious!
702;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, come on... This one's so hard to hold. The F chord is too hard!
703;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That takes me back. I was this way at the start, too.
704;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ryo-senpai! Hello...
705;1;3;Be Right There;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You guys're here early.
706;1;3;Be Right There;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She really is eating weeds!
707;1;3;Be Right There;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Senpai's so wild!
708;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm just awful.
709;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh... But you at least managed to play it to the en—
710;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;About that, though!
711;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes?
712;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I just realized, I'm supposed to do vocals too, right? But I can't sing while I'm focusing all my motor control on the guitar.
713;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... I see...
714;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I was thinking it might be better for the band if I just sang... But then I wouldn't have anything to do during interludes, and I'd probably start fidgeting on stage... Oh, um... Yeah! So... I guess I'd better work harder!
715;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;I was thinking it might be better for the band if I just sang... But then I wouldn't have anything to do during interludes, and I'd probably start fidgeting on stage... Oh, um... Yeah! So... I guess I'd better work harder! Kit-aura!
716;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;My eyes!
717;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;My eyes! N-Nothing.
718;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;My eyes! N-Nothing. Her eager self-improvement power is too bright to look directly at!
719;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But are you sure it's all right for me to sing? I know! You should sing with me!
720;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-N-Not happening!
721;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;B-But...
722;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N...
723;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm sorry. Is it that unpleasant a thought?
724;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Hey, nice one. Is that some new guitar showmanship move?
725;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Senpai! Do you like it? Then I'll practice it too!
726;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You don't need to practice that. Ryo's here, so let's meet up at the club!
727;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Right!
728;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We will now begin the band meeting! Round of applause! Now, here's today's topic! The question: How can we be more band-like?
729;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;It's so half-assed!
730;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's so half-assed!
731;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Now that we've got a full member lineup, I figured the first order of business was to get us acting more band-like!
732;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... I see!
733;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I know practice is crucial, but there's gotta be more to us than that! I think we should talk about all kinds of stuff!
734;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Is she trying to give Kita-san a break from all her practice?
735;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;One tactic is to nail the superficial stuff first!
736;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, that totally works! Like if you start imitating a new popular make-up technique and end up looking great!
737;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Exactly!
738;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's like they're speaking a foreign language...
739;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;And with that in mind... I made us band merch!
740;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That's a more superficial starting point than I expected!
741;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Did you just put a zip tie around your wrist?
742;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Cute, huh? They come in all colors!
743;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;We'll sell them for 500 yen a piece.
744;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What a ripoff!
745;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;650 if they're signed.
746;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What a steal! I'll take one!
747;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Won't that just be circulating money within the band?
748;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Anyone else with ideas for becoming more band-like?
749;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I can set us up an Isstagram and run it!
750;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Great idea! I hereby appoint you Minister of Social Media!
751;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;And I'll post every day when the time comes!
752;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;And... What about forming a fan club?
753;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That's awfully hasty!
754;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;10,000 yen annual membership fee.
755;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That's awfully expensive!
756;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Membership perks include meet-and-greets and a once-a-year takoyaki party with the band. The fans bring the ingredients.
757;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What a steal! I'll join!
758;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, you're already in the band.
759;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What about you, Gotoh-san? Any ideas?
760;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What do I do? I wasn't even thinking!
761;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;What do I do? I wasn't even thinking! W-Well...
762;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What do I do? I wasn't even thinking! W-Well... H-Her eyes are so sparkly! I feel the burden of expectation!
763;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;What do I do? I wasn't even thinking! W-Well... H-Her eyes are so sparkly! I feel the burden of expectation! Um... Um...
764;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What do I do? I wasn't even thinking! W-Well... H-Her eyes are so sparkly! I feel the burden of expectation! Um... Um... I-If I don't say something, I... I... Nothing's coming to mind! What do I... What do I...
765;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, Bocchi-chan can sit this one out. She has a more important job: writing lyrics for our original song! We settled on it before, remember? Ryo would write the music, and you'd write the lyrics! If you've got off-limits words, Bocchi-chan, you should write the lyrics! write the lyrics! write the lyrics! write the lyrics!
766;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Wow! I can't wait to hear your song, Ryo-senpai. Have you written it already?
767;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;No. I'll do it once I get inspiration.
768;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I just can't wait!
769;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Go for it, Ryo! And Minister of Lyrics!
770;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right...
771;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, it's so cool that you took on such a tough job!
772;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Cool?! W-Well, I can write lyrics like nobody's business! It's the super-easiest thing ever!
773;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You get carried away so easily, Gotoh-san.
774;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm gonna write the most band-like lyrics and guarantee us a huge hit!
775;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Band-like?
776;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I couldn't think of anything!
777;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Futari Gotou;Talk;Shake! Change paws!
778;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I failed to write a single lyric, but I've perfected my signature...
779;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Futari Gotou;Inner Voice;Change, and pose!
780;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Isn't it cool? Why can't I get my priorities in order?!
781;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Futari Gotou;Talk;Jimmyhen's amazing!
782;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Futari!
783;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I already spent five hours yesterday editing video to escape reality. Done. I'm so stupid! I'm a paramecium!
784;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Futari Gotou;Talk;Whatcha writin'?
785;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;No!
786;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Here it is! My lyrics notebook from middle school! A curse? Let's get organized. Kita-san's gonna be singing this song. Cheerful lyrics. A seishun song, maybe?
787;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;Kit-aura!
788;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I could easily write depressing lyrics, of course...
789;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;Kit-aura!
790;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Nobody wants that, so I've gotta write something band-like, with real Kit-aura! Put yourself in the mind of cheery person! I'm an extrovert! The woman who surfs in the pool at night! The woman who claims the title Queen of Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Go! Go!
791;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Nobody wants that, so I've gotta write something band-like, with real Kit-aura! Put yourself in the mind of cheery person! I'm an extrovert! The woman who surfs in the pool at night! The woman who claims the title Queen of Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Go! Go! Let's get some vibes up in here! Tequila shots in the house!
792;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Nobody wants that, so I've gotta write something band-like, with real Kit-aura! Put yourself in the mind of cheery person! I'm an extrovert! The woman who surfs in the pool at night! The woman who claims the title Queen of Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Go! Go! Let's get some vibes up in here! Tequila shots in the house! No! That's not a cheery person, it's just a party animal! No more shortcuts. You must become Kita-san.
793;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Nobody wants that, so I've gotta write something band-like, with real Kit-aura! Put yourself in the mind of cheery person! I'm an extrovert! The woman who surfs in the pool at night! The woman who claims the title Queen of Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Woot! Go! Go! Let's get some vibes up in here! Tequila shots in the house! No! That's not a cheery person, it's just a party animal! No more shortcuts. You must become Kita-san. Come over now if you wanna go to Shibuya! Everyone takes Isstaworthy pics right here! They'll be launching fireworks in ten mins, so let's take pictures together then!
794;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Michiyo Gotou;Talk;I know an exorcist, if you need one...
795;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's n-n-n-not like that!
796;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Okay, no seishun songs. Let's try a song of encouragement. I personally find status-quo-affirming lyrics annoyingly irresponsible, but... It's so shallow... Any depressed person hearing this song would just drop deeper into despair!
797;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;F-F-Forgive me!
798;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san?
799;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What's the matter now?
800;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-Isn't this an intervention where you tear into me for failing to write lyrics despite all the bragging I did?
801;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's perverse! No way!
802;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Then why did you call us here?
803;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I didn't think of it until now, but there's one other really band-like thing we can do! Take ProPhos!
804;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Promotional photos, she means.
805;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Since Bocchi-chan isn't in Kessoku Band's current ProPho.
806;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Current?
807;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Want to see? We took it for our last concert.
808;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I mean, since Kita-chan ditched us...
809;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm sorry!
810;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I've never seen such an awful ProPho.
811;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So, because it's nice out today and none of us have plans, I figured we'd take a few ProPhos!
812;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;O-Outside?!
813;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We don't have the money to rent a studio, so...
814;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Taking public pictures in Shimo-Kita is too much to ask of a nerd like me!
815;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We could do it in Starry instead if you prefer, but a ProPho is important for conveying a band's direction and the unique qualities of its members.
816;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;So we really need to give it everything we have?
817;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Precisely! We need something that'll have impact, whether it's in a club ad online, a flyer, or a magazine!
818;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;What she said.
819;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;V-Very well. I resign myself to this fate.
820;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Resign yourself? I declare this ProPho-scouting journey on! Let's la go!
821;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah!
822;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yeah...
823;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Stairs... A fence... With plants... At the park... I think we've covered all the bases for broke band ProPhos... Oh, and an evocative wall!
824;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I wish we'd brought our instruments.
825;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;G-Good point... Having our instruments might make us look cooler.
826;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;For you guys, maybe. Only guitarists and bassists look cool that way. What about the poor drummer? I'm stuck just holding up my drumsticks!
827;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;But that's cute.
828;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Then let's swap instruments, just for today!
829;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Nah, that's lame.
830;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What about here? Isn't it nice? With all these posters up, it has a real "Shimo-Kitazawa" vibe!
831;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;That used to be a CD shop I went to a lot.
832;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Huh?
833;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Lots of record shops and club venues closing these days, yeah.
834;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Shops that have been there for decades, disappearing one by one...
835;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I-I'm really sorry...
836;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ryo, you were just celebrating that new book store.
837;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah. I love B&C.
838;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, don't let Ryo jerk you around. Ninety percent of the things she says are more or less just for vibes.
839;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But Senpai can jerk me around any time she wants!
840;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Um? Oh, it's just Bocchi-chan.
841;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;U-Um... I-I thought I saw a n-nice-looking wall over there...
842;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, great work!
843;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Taking it now! We're definitely capturing everyone's personalities, but it's not really band-like. Isn't there a way to really make it scream "band"?
844;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;As I am the quintessential musician, you need only mimic my expression.
845;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'd love to know where you get all that confidence...
846;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But we can't go wrong doing what Senpai says! Right, Gotoh-san?
847;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes...
848;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;A pair of yes-men, huh? Fine, we'll do it. Looks like we're at a funeral.
849;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yeah...
850;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But Kita-chan looks cute in any pic we take!
851;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Aw, no I don't!
852;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sure you do! It's almost like you know what you're doing.
853;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, I guess it's because I upload pics to Issta all the time! See?
854;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's our Minister of Social Media!
855;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Bocchi-chan's dying! What's wrong, Gotoh-san? Stay with us! Oh, no! She's flopping around like a fish!
856;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I've never taken pictures with friends before.
857;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What do I do? Please, wake up!
858;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Since... I never had friends before. The only pictures I've taken that weren't with family were class pictures. With those as my only proof of existence for the past fifteen years...
859;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Look at Bocchi-chan's weird face!
860;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I wonder if there are any other high school girls like me still around? Perhaps I've become a rare species, on par with the tsuchinoko?
861;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I wonder if there are any other high school girls like me still around? Perhaps I've become a rare species, on par with the tsuchinoko? I am... I am the tsuchinoko of Shimo-Kitazawa.
862;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san's saying the strangest things!
863;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nah, this is normal for her.
864;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Noko-noko. Noko-noko.
865;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, why don't you start your own Isstagram? What do you think, Minister?
866;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Totally! Let's become friends! If we're going to be a band, we should really have individual member accounts! Gotoh-san?!
867;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;If I were to get an account... Someone with self-esteem so bad she's already trying to form a band to get popular despite total social ineptitude... If s-someone like me were to start an account like that... You would witness the birth of... The attention-whore monster! Like my posts! Like my posts! My video site is all I need.
868;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san!
869;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan!
870;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We won't push you to get on social media anymore! Please come back to us!
871;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You okay?
872;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes...
873;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, back to the ProPhos!
874;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nothing's really hitting the spot...
875;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, what about a jump pic?
876;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Jump pic?
877;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It's really photogenic, and it could bring out everyone's personality!
878;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Great idea! You're a genius, Kita-chan!
879;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;A wise man once said, any anime where they jump in the OP is a god-tier anime. Would jumping in our ProPho thus make us a god-tier band?
880;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Where is she getting that from?
881;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm not sure I followed your logic there... But let's give it a try! Five, four, three,
882;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I c-can't even remember the last time I jumped!
883;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;two, one!
884;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Oh, I see Bocchi's undies.
885;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Wow, that's one hell of a picture!
886;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm sorry for putting something so worthless in the picture. Please delete it.
887;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I was hoping for a cuter reaction there...
888;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;If I can't even jump properly, I'm...
889;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, let's try one more!
890;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Awesome! It's got the band feel and the seishun thing going!
891;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Do you think I could get a copy of that picture?
892;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;M-Me too!
893;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, we're feeling band-like now! I feel like we're one step closer to becoming a popular band!
894;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
895;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Kessoku Band is getting started for real!
896;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay! We'll have our concert in summer (TBD), our demo CD sale (TBD), our first album release in winter (TBD), and become Shimo-Kitazawa's own good vibes-iest vibes-band!
897;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Sounds like there's a lot still to be decided!
898;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Good point! We don't even have a song yet!
899;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I t-totally forgot about the lyrics!
900;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Of course, we've got Ryo and Bocchi-chan on the case, so... Hey, where's Ryo?
901;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;She must have disappeared.
902;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What a total free spirit! Anyway, thanks for coming today! Dismissed!
903;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The more time that passes, the higher the lyrics bar seems to rise. I-If I show them this and they're mean to me... O-Or worse, if they're obviously humoring me, I... M-Maybe I should show it to someone and see how they react. Ryo-san, maybe. I don't think Ryo-san would ever humor me.
904;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Message;a
905;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Message;It's a pleasure to make contact with you This is Bocchi speaking \hIf you happen to still be in Shimo-Kita, \hdo you think you might be able to \h\hconsider having a look at my lyrics?
906;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's a pleasure to make contact with you This is Bocchi speaking \hIf you happen to still be in Shimo-Kita, \hdo you think you might be able to \h\hconsider having a look at my lyrics? She already read it!
907;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Message;I'm here, come by
908;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Huh? A t-trendy café!
909;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I've never been to a real restaurant by myself. I can't even enter a convenience store without psyching myself up in advance. A-Am I allowed to just walk in? How do people just walk into places? How do they do it on TV and stuff? Oh, I know!
910;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I've never been to a real restaurant by myself. I can't even enter a convenience store without psyching myself up in advance. A-Am I allowed to just walk in? How do people just walk into places? How do they do it on TV and stuff? Oh, I know! Are ya winning, diners?
911;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Oh, Bocchi. Over here.
912;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-This is awkward. Come to think of it, I've never been alone with Ryo-san before. I don't even know much about her. F-For that matter, why hasn't she talked to me yet?
913;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;That was delicious.
914;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She finished eating! What do I do? Should I initiate? But... That photo shoot sure was fun, huh?!
915;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Imagination;Not really.
916;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That could be the result!
917;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Just show me the lyrics.
918;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, right. Thank you.
919;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;No problem. Let's see. Oh, ohh!
920;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She's unusually flustered!
921;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;This is good.
922;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm not sure I agree, but for the band's sake... Yes, it's a masterpiece.
923;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Though personally I think one is a bit childish for a band.
924;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;That's not the right page!
925;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Are you personally satisfied with these lyrics, Bocchi?
926;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, w-well... I figured we should do something really "hit band"-like...
927;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Did I ever tell you? I was in another band a long time ago. Their lyrics were awkward, but I liked how honest they were. But, desperate for sales, they started going in a more commercial direction. I hated that. That's why I quit. We had a little fight about it at the time. And just as I was feeling sick of the whole band thing...
928;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey. If you've got time, will you play bass for me?
929;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Why?
930;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Because I love the way you play!
931;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;When Nijika said that to me, I decided to give playing in a band another try. Abandoning your uniqueness is equivalent to dying.
932;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Ryo-san?
933;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;So don't write generic lyrics based on other concerns. Write what you want to write.
934;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-But if I do that, I'll write bitter, social-outcast lyrics—
935;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;But won't it be hilarious if a normie sings that?
936;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I spend my days cursing you losers!
937;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Bringing a wide variety of individuals together into one sound... That's the color that Kessoku Band will have.
938;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Ryo-san is actually a considerate person.
939;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Let's get out of here.
940;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right! Oh, Ryo-san... The check...
941;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sorry, I'm broke. Treat me?
942;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wh-What? B-But you're the one who invited me...
943;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;I just couldn't take another day of eating weeds.
944;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;You're still doing that?!
945;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;And this shop just opened, and I wanted to eat here so bad... Please, treat me?
946;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I t-take back what I said!
947;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;I really am sorry. I'll pay you back next month.
948;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No need to rush... U-Um... I-I'm going to try my best!
949;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sure. Can't wait to see it.
950;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;U-Um... I f-finished the lyrics... H-Here.
951;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, are you all right? You look tired.
952;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm fine. I've just been so focused on the lyrics, I c-completely forgot to sleep...
953;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Wow! Let's have a look! I can't wait to see the fruits of your labors!
954;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Talk;It m-might be... too much of a downer.
955;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;It certainly is a downer.
956;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ryo-senpai!
957;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;But it's very Bocchi. It might not connect with too many people, but those it does, it'll hit deeply.
958;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Where'd this friendship come from?!
959;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But these lyrics really are super great, Bocchi-chan!
960;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I love this phrase here!
961;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Ryo Yamada;Talk;Same.
962;1;4;Jumping Girl(s);Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I m-managed to figure out the lyrics. I'm going to do my best... I hope the band can stay together forever... and I can get lots of pictures with everyone.
963;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;And whipped cream up to the ceiling!
964;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Excuse me, girls. It's your long-awaited payday.
965;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yay!
966;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yay.
967;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Thanks!
968;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Thank you very much.
969;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thank you!
970;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Sure. And for you, Bocchi-chan.
971;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you!
972;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-Thank you! T-Ten thousand yen! 10,000 Yen The culmination of my blood, sweat, and tears! What'll I spend it on? New sheet music? A big manga haul? Maybe I'll buy a cake and surprise my family!
973;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sorry to rain on various parades, but I've gotta collect these for the concert!
974;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Lend me your ears. My new song, "A Farewell to Yukichi."
975;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm so sorry! I hate it too, okay?
976;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That's right. I was doing this job thing to pay our concert quota. Of course, if I work hard here every month, Kessoku Band will get to play a lot, which is just about—
977;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm sorry to you too, Kita-chan!
978;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, it's fine! Wow! Does it really cost that much to make an album?
979;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Huh?
980;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, I'd like to have them to sell at our concerts, and shooting a music video and stuff will cost a ton, too...
981;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We'll just have to get second jobs during summer vacation!
982;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah. Maybe we could work at a beach house or something!
983;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'd love to work at the beach!
984;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;B-Beach?!
985;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Or maybe an amusement park!
986;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's a no-go.
987;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That would be so fun!
988;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;They won't lend to minors. But perhaps, deeper in the internet's shadier corners... I'll have to sell my liver.
989;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Bocchi.
990;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm s-sure I could get a loan using my guitar as collateral, s-so please don't make me get another job! P-Please don't make me work at the beach or an amusement park!
991;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Actually, I wrote the song.
992;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Is it just me, or is it really good?
993;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah, it's great!
994;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;When I read Bocchi's lyrics, it just came to me.
995;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's awesome! All the hard work paid off!
996;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;That's my girl. There, there.
997;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;S-Senpai! I'm working hard, too! Watch me! I've gotten so good at guitar!
998;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Amazing.
999;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Amazing?! Please give me chin rubs, too!
1000;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;There, there.
1001;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;My dream might just come true. Okay! I'll ask Sis to let us hold our concert here next month!
1002;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You hadn't asked her yet?
1003;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No worries! She let us in right away last time! Right, Sis?
1004;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I'm not putting you on.
1005;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Huh?
1006;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Huh?
1007;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Huh?
1008;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Huh?
1009;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But why? We just finished our original song.
1010;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Why should I care about that?
1011;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-This feels super awkward...
1012;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We can even pay our quota if we don't bring in customers!
1013;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;It's not about the money. It's about your skill.
1014;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But you let us play last time.
1015;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I made an exception so you could make a memory.
1016;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Make a memory?
1017;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Normally, I'd make you play first to apply. You know that, right?
1018;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, but...
1019;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Sorry, but I can't have a repeat of that awful May performance.
1020;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Can't have a repeat... You mean we...
1021;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Just stick with it as a hobby or something. You got more to say?
1022;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You can't even sleep without stuffed animals to cuddle!
1023;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ijichi-senpai!
1024;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;That was a weird parting shot.
1025;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Would the stuffed animals in question be this beat-up panda and rabbit?
1026;1;5;Flightless Fish;PA-san;Talk;That's cute.
1027;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Delete that image! Immediately!
1028;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What are you doing? We have to go after her! Don't act like it's too much trouble! You too, Gotoh-san! Let's go!
1029;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
1030;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Wait, Bocchi-chan.
1031;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes?
1032;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Y-Yes? What, what, what? What, what, what?!
1033;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's so obvious when you're sulking.
1034;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Shut up.
1035;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Senpai, are you all right?
1036;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sorry to rush out like that. She didn't have to be such a jerk about it, you know?
1037;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;E-Excuse me!
1038;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan?
1039;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;E-Excuse me... M-Manager... said... She said...
1040;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, breathe first!
1041;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Here, Bocchi-chan!
1042;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you.
1043;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Feel better?
1044;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes. Um... The manager told me...
1045;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Tell Nijika. If she wants to perform, she needs to audition. I'll watch the performances next Saturday and decide... What? What are you doing?
1046;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I'm desperately attempting to show obedience!
1047;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You should probably go after them before you lose them.
1048;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;W-Woof!
1049;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;When a dog rolls over to show its belly, some believe that's not a show of submission, but a show of aggression.
1050;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ryo-senpai knows so much! But wait a minute... Does that mean...
1051;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;An audition?!
1052;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah! And if we pass, she'll let us perform?
1053;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes.
1054;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well, why didn't she just say so to begin with? That sister of mine is so mean!
1055;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But that means we just have to work hard! Isn't that nice?
1056;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, that's right.
1057;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You've got that "those two are the biggest problem" look on your face.
1058;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Erk!
1059;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We'll record your parts in advance, so just practice miming along!
1060;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Right!
1061;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Right!
1062;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No! No air guitars!
1063;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We've only got a week. Don't push them so hard.
1064;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Even if they suck, the passion will come through if they try!
1065;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;We suck?
1066;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;We suck?
1067;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, sorry! You're really both way better than you were. Right, Ryo? C'mon, back me up here! B-Bocchi-chan? Please don't turn into a pipe shut-in!
1068;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sorry for my momentary arrogance over my success in writing lyrics.
1069;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ah, it's The Sound of Bocchi!
1070;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Those with uncontrollable arrogance deserve a life inside a dark, dank pipe.
1071;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;Huh? They think she isn't good? Gotoh-san? At least when I heard her at school before, even I could tell as a novice that she's really good. Was that just dumb luck before?
1072;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;C'mon, come out now! Please just come out!
1073;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;If I could remove myself from your memory, I would...
1074;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So long as the rhythm section's strong, it'll probably work out.
1075;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You think?
1076;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah! I don't think they need to see us all playing on Ryo's level.
1077;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Then what do they need to see?
1078;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hmm... enthusiasm? Growth as a band?
1079;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Growth?
1080;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, thank you. For practicing with me.
1081;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-It's nothing...
1082;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But shouldn't we practice in a classroom instead of this dreary place?
1083;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, w-well, actually...
1084;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, w-well, actually... How am I supposed to practice with all those judging eyes asking, What's a cool girl like Kita doing with that loser?!"
1085;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, I get it! You don't want to bother people by playing in a classroom! You're so considerate, Gotoh-san!
1086;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She always assumes my motivations are pure! What a nice person!
1087;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, Gotoh-san... I've been thinking about it. I think we just need to show that we've grown as a band— in other words, how hard we've been working.
1088;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right.
1089;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;When the time comes, I want to be able to say I gave it my all, and that I don't have any regrets. So please stick with me until the day of the audition!
1090;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;P-Please don't bow! I-I'm the one who's h-happy to be here!
1091;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What's with the hair? What are we doing?
1092;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;V-Visually showing our growth as a band"... Apparently.
1093;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;More of Ryo's mischief?
1094;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Drinking, smoking, dalliances with women, and the mop-top hairstyle... It all equals "band."
1095;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You're laying it on a little thick! And no smoking or drinking until you're twenty!
1096;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Everyone say, "mop-top"!
1097;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Nijika.
1098;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Gotten it out of your system?
1099;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We've got an opening for uneven bangs that hide one eye and a perpetually annoyed expression."
1100;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'll pass, thanks.
1101;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;U-Um... I c-can't have dalliances with women. I d-don't think any women would want to dally with me...
1102;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Don't worry. Stand in front of VillePan in Shimo-Kitazawa, wearing your guitar and looking listless, and someone'll come up to you sooner or later.
1103;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Cut it out! Stop misinforming her with your subjective experience! Let's do it right!
1104;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;But growth isn't always visible. And the criteria is quite vague.
1105;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No, it's very clear! We just need to convince Sis to take us on! Practice is the only way! Now, get changed! You too, Kita-chan!
1106;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;R-Right!
1107;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I think I get what Ryo-san's saying, though. It's hard to know exactly what "growth" means. I don't think it's quite the same as effort put in. My life as of late has been a whirlwind. I started working. I've gained the ability to occasionally look others in the eye. But I don't think that's the same thing as growing as a band. I've just evolved past the water flea or euglena stage and now stand at the starting line of basic humanity. I thought finally starting the band I dreamed about would be growth in itself, but... I...
1108;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ow!
1109;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Your finger's looking better.
1110;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, let's call it a day.
1111;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Already?
1112;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah. Get a good night's rest for the audition tomorrow.
1113;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;See you.
1114;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Great work, all!
1115;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! Sorry, sorry! Didn't mean to startle you.
1116;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-It's okay.
1117;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Cola, right?
1118;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wh-Wh-What? Yes?
1119;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Here!
1120;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you.
1121;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sorry if I forced you to go along with this. I mean, you kind of just got roped into joining Kessoku Band from the start, right? I remember you saying... you'd been wanting to be part of a band, but I never actually asked you what kind of band you wanted to be in, or what your reasons were for playing in this band now.
1122;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, well...
1123;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, well... Should I tell her I started because I wanted people going crazy for me?
1124;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Everyone's got their own reasons, right? It's not like performing live is the only way to go now. You can always post videos and stuff nowadays if what you want is to get your sound out there.
1125;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's true. I like uploading as guitarhero too, and I have to admit that the online world suits me well...
1126;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;See... I've got this kind of goal. A dream, really. So I can get a little fired up without realizing it. So... I worry I might have dragged you into this against your will.
1127;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-N-Not at all! It's n-n-not against my will at all!
1128;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Really? That's good.
1129;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;The reason you wanted a band... It's to get famous and perform at the Budokan, right?
1130;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;My real dream is actually a little past that. But I can't tell you just yet! Anyway, see you tomorrow!
1131;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We're Kessoku Band. We're going to play our song, Guitar, Solitude, and the Blue Planet!
1132;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I spent all night thinking about my reason for playing in this band now. I do still want to become popular and have everyone go crazy for me... But now... it's not just for me. It's the four of us! I never figured out what it means to have "growth." But right now, what I want is to stay with this band and have people go crazy for us! I want to make Nijika-chan's actual dream come true.
1133;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Thank you for having us!
1134;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thank you for having us!
1135;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Thank you for having us!
1136;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Thank you for having us!
1137;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Pretty good. Or so I'd like to say, but... Drums, you're too tense. Guitars, you're both looking down too much. Bass, you're too holed up in your own little world. Still... I think I know what kind of band you are now.
1138;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Thank you... for the feedback.
1139;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Huh? What's with that reaction?
1140;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;W-Well... I mean...
1141;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I'm saying, I learned what kind of band you are! This is the part where you cheer.
1142;1;5;Flightless Fish;PA-san;Talk;I think she's saying you passed.
1143;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;That's what I said! You passed!
1144;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sis, you're so misleading!
1145;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Y-You mean... we did it?
1146;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We did it! She says we passed!
1147;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yes!
1148;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We really did it?
1149;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yes!
1150;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ryo, did you catch it?
1151;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, we did it!
1152;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes!
1153;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It hasn't been long, but Bocchi-chan's playing is so different.
1154;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san!
1155;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yes!
1156;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You were really incredible there, Gotoh-san.
1157;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;E-Excuse me, Kita-san!
1158;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san? Gotoh-san?!
1159;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Did we just imagine that performance?
1160;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Did we just imagine that performance?
1161;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Need a glass of water?
1162;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sorry. Too many new things at once put my stomach acid into overdrive...
1163;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, you're okay! Of course your stomach's freaked out a little!
1164;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I can't believe we passed!
1165;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I knew it from the start. I've even thought up our next song.
1166;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Awesome! That's my senpai!
1167;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well, easy to say after it's done.
1168;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Let's all take a picture!
1169;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Can't I clean the floor first?
1170;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Inner Voice;She really is good. But she's so inexperienced playing with a team that her lack of self-confidence holds her back. She could grow even more.
1171;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Huh? Has the manager been making eye contact with me?
1172;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Inner Voice;To give her confidence, she needs to know someone out there acknowledges her talent.
1173;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She's looking at me! Is she mad?! Because I let victory make me arrogant?
1174;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, kid. I see you, okay?
1175;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She's watching me!
1176;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, Gotoh-san! Let's take our picture!
1177;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's over.
1178;1;5;Flightless Fish;PA-san;Talk;Manager. Admit it. You liked them from the start. C'mon, you've been keeping a window open in the concert schedule for them. Why tease them like that?
1179;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I wasn't teasing. I just didn't want to put them on until they were ready. But while they're still rough around the edges, I think they've got something. As her sister, I need to be hard on her to make sure her band grows.
1180;1;5;Flightless Fish;PA-san;Talk;Is this what they call a sister complex?
1181;1;5;Flightless Fish;Seika Ijichi;Talk;One more word about that, and you're fired.
1182;1;5;Flightless Fish;PA-san;Talk;Right.
1183;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay! Let's work even harder to level up our band in the lead-up to the concert!
1184;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Right!
1185;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Right!
1186;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Right!
1187;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Bocchi, I'm looking forward to the new lyrics.
1188;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
1189;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Isn't this getting exciting, Gotoh-san?!
1190;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes!
1191;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Y-Yes! Th-That's right! It's not over at all! In fact, Kessoku Band's journey is just getting started!
1192;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Now, since the ticket quota is twenty at 1,500 yen each, that means we each sell five!
1193;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Five-ticket quota... Five-ticket quota?!
1194;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Five tickets, right? Got it!
1195;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Five-ticket quota?! Father...
1196;1;5;Flightless Fish;Naoki Gotou;Imagination;My daughter's inscribing her name into rock history...
1197;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Mother...
1198;1;5;Flightless Fish;Michiyo Gotou;Imagination;I'll cook some red rice!
1199;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sister...
1200;1;5;Flightless Fish;Futari Gotou;Imagination;You're awesome, Sis!
1201;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Dog...
1202;1;5;Flightless Fish;Dog;Imagination;Woof!
1203;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Father, mother, sister, dog! Father, mother, sister, dog! Father, mother, sister, dog! Father, mother, sister, dog! I-I... I h-have one left over!
1204;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san is so happy, she's crying!
1205;1;5;Flightless Fish;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We have to put on a great concert together!
1206;1;5;Flightless Fish;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah.
1207;1;5;Flightless Fish;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I-It's really over this time.
1208;1;6;Eight Views;Guitar man;Talk;Let's recap the show so far! Hitori Gotoh is a slightly shy, socially anxious, and isolated guitar enthusiast!
1209;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;This guitar's my friend! But some day, I might like to join a band!
1210;1;6;Eight Views;Guitar man;Talk;And as she was thinking that...
1211;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Imagination;Hey, come join our band!
1212;1;6;Eight Views;Guitar man;Talk;From that humble beginning, she formed a rock band with this group of colorful characters! Since then, her life has been one event after another! And just now, the club manager said, I can't put you on stage unless you pass an audition," which inspired a huge panic! And after hours and hours of practice...
1213;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Imagination;Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
1214;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Imagination;Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
1215;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Imagination;Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
1216;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Imagination;Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
1217;1;6;Eight Views;Guitar man;Talk;They managed to pass their audition! Happiness bloomed! Or so they thought, but Hitori Gotoh still had a towering wall before her! It was... That five-person ticket quota! What was a girl with no contacts outside of her family and band to do?! What will you do? What will you do, Hitori—
1218;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Only ten days to the concert.
1219;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Father, mother, sister, dog. One ticket left for... Grandma? B-But I doubt she'd make the three-hour trip just to see me play...
1220;1;6;Eight Views;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Good. You know Jimihen can't come, right?
1221;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You think? I s-sort of had a feeling, but... I wasn't sure...
1222;1;6;Eight Views;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Futari can't go to a club like that either. She's only five.
1223;1;6;Eight Views;Futari Gotou;Talk;Aw, no fun!
1224;1;6;Eight Views;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;It's scary in there.
1225;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father. Mother, father... Mother, father... Mother, father... Mother, father... Mother, father...
1226;1;6;Eight Views;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;I could invite some of my friends. My friends. My friends. My friends.
1227;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Mother?
1228;1;6;Eight Views;Futari Gotou;Talk;It's not like Sis has friends of her own!
1229;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I might not talk about them, but I've got lots of friends at school.
1230;1;6;Eight Views;Futari Gotou;Talk;Lia—
1231;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;You shouldn't say that, even as a joke. You should grow up to have empathy for others.
1232;1;6;Eight Views;Futari Gotou;Talk;S-Sorry.
1233;1;6;Eight Views;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Sounds like I should talk to my friends.
1234;1;6;Eight Views;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Me too—
1235;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-N-N— N-No, that's okay! I've got lots of friends at school. S-See?! You just wait for that concert!
1236;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I shouldn't have bragged like that. What do I do? If I don't find buyers for three more tickets... I made these promotional flyers to hand out around my neighborhood, but...
1237;1;6;Eight Views;Guitar man;Talk;I read online that stuff with a handmade feel comes across as more charming!
1238;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;But honestly... How is someone with social anxiety supposed to hand out flyers? I feel so powerless. I'm too scared to even move.
1239;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Message;Looks like lots of my friends are coming! Thank goodness!
1240;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Message;I got 'em sold.
1241;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Message;How are you doing, Bocchi-chan? Coming today? I want to try the new song all together!
1242;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-They're all taking care of it! Wh-What do I say back? I got that quota covered! and pretend I'm okay? Or do I just admit, I can't handle the quota!? But if I do that...
1243;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Imagination;You can't be in the band if you can't handle your quota.
1244;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Imagination;Bye-bye, Bocchi.
1245;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Imagination;Senpai! I searched through my extensive connections and found us an amazing and totally extroverted guitarist!
1246;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Imagination;Yeah! Rock you!
1247;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Imagination;Yeah! Rock you!
1248;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Imagination;Yeah! Rock you!
1249;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Imagination;Yeah! Rock you!
1250;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Why couldn't I just accept my mom's help?!
1251;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;A p-person's collapsed. Wh-What do I do? I've got to say something... Actually, I need an ambulance!
1252;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A p-person's collapsed. Wh-What do I do? I've got to say something... Actually, I need an ambulance! H-Hello?
1253;1;6;Eight Views;Phone;Talk;This is the news for 4:30 pm...
1254;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;W-Water... Please...
1255;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right! I'll go buy some—
1256;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;A-And hangover medicine.
1257;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
1258;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;And miso soup with clams... And rice porridge too... Preferably in a bed dressed with freshly line-dried sheets...
1259;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She's very demanding.
1260;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Ah, right to the liver! You're a lifesaver! Thanks so much! I didn't think you'd really buy me the miso soup!
1261;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-It's nothing.
1262;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;I wanna take off my head and power-wash it!
1263;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I ended up helping a very weird person.
1264;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;I wanna take out my guts and wring out all the alcohol!
1265;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;W-Well, I should be going...
1266;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Say, what's your name?
1267;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Hitori Gotoh.
1268;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;What a cute name!
1269;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you.
1270;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Drinking should be done in moderation, y'know? She said as she started drinking again! Hair of the dog that bit ya! So good!
1271;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She's still drinking. What should I do? Just leave?
1272;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Ya want some too, Hitori-chan? Sorry it's the cheap stuff.
1273;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No, thanks...
1274;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Wait, you're underage, right? Hey, you listenin'?
1275;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Yeah, she's way too weird.
1276;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Why haven't ya said anything?
1277;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I can't tell if she's serious or playing dumb.
1278;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Hitori-chan, you're cold as ice! Like concrete!
1279;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;On the count of three, I book it!
1280;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Wh-Whaddya want? Ya want some booze after all?
1281;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I sh-should be going...
1282;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Hey, a guitar! Do ya play? I'm in a band too! Indie, of course.
1283;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She plays too?!
1284;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Hey, can ya play?
1285;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm s-s-s-so scared! I've never talked to a grown-up rocker before! I d-don't know why, but I bet she'll be mad!
1286;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Imagination;Lemme see! Lemme see! Sheesh, kids these days... You don't know what rock is!
1287;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I have to get out of here before I say something stupid.
1288;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;What's with you, Hitori-chan?
1289;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A-A-A-Actually I bought it but gave up after one day, so I was just heading to a pawn shop to sell it!
1290;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Uh?
1291;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I was hoping for a far more worthy person to use this guitar and truly find their wings and soar, but I d-d-don't play at all! Sorry! Gosh, wonder how much I'll get for it! It's all-you-can-eat yakiniku for me today!
1292;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Wait! Giving up after one day is a waste. You can sell it any time you want. But if you stick with it a little while longer, you might become worthy of that guitar someday. Oh, listen to me! Tryin' to sound all wise...
1293;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Wait. Is she kind of normal after all?
1294;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Oh, I know. How's about I give you lessons?
1295;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, actually, sorry... I lied about everything I said just now.
1296;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;That's a heck of a smooth lie you told.
1297;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Wow, nice guitar! It's clear you take good care of it.
1298;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you.
1299;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;I play bass. Booze and the bass are worth more to me than my life, so I always keep them close by.
1300;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;So, uh... Where's your bass?
1301;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;I left it at the pub. Let's go grab it, Hitori-chan!
1302;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;She values her life so little...
1303;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, hey. Have you heard back from Bocchi-chan?
1304;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Still left on read.
1305;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Maybe we shouldn't have sent those LOINEs.
1306;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I don't think that's it. Today's our practice day. I'm sure she's just busy.
1307;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You think? But what if we overwhelmed her?
1308;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I get how she feels. I've felt that pressure so many times myself.
1309;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, right! Sheesh... Boy, I sure hope she's okay!
1310;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Ta-dah! My very own bass! Super Ultra Shuton Doki EX!
1311;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-This is all too incomprehensible. I'm struggling.
1312;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Cool, huh?
1313;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes. Very cool.
1314;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;We really rocked the house at our concert last night! But I drank way too much at the afterparty. Next thing I knew, the sun was up, and I had no idea where I was!
1315;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-How many hours did you spend drinking?
1316;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Lesse... The afterparty started at ten, so... I was pretty out of it most of the time, so... Figure I might as well stay up 'til tonight.
1317;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You really like drinking that much?
1318;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Sure do! Drinking lets me forget everything, so I just...
1319;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Everything?
1320;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;You know, like fears about the future. Pension problems! Rural depopulation! The poverty gap! Fears about the future Caregiving Pension crisis Stressful society Low wages Marriage Loss of lifetime careers Depression Job searches Rural depopulation Helplessness Old age Poverty gap Life is pain More, more! Body builds up tolerance, gotta drink more Craving is temporarily satisfied Happiness Spiral Unable to think of anything but alcohol I'm out of alcohol! The alcohol is gone! fidget fidget Gotta get booze! I call it a Happiness Spiral!
1321;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um...
1322;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Um... What a sad kind of happiness.
1323;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Doesn't ring true, huh? You'll understand when you're older, Hitori-chan.
1324;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A-Actually...
1325;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;A-Actually... I'd really rather I didn't!
1326;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;You'll be super into drinking, I bet! I can tell just by looking at your face!
1327;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I wonder what I'd look like drunk...
1328;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Mom's stopped bugging me to go to the employment agency. Bet she's too busy with her grandkids. Futari's a mama now, after all. I know it's not good for things to stay this way, but I don't see how I could pull myself together now. Those high school days in the band... Feels like a lifetime ago. Boy, I sure was shining back then... Wonder what they're all up to now. But what would I even say if I saw them?
1329;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Mom's stopped bugging me to go to the employment agency. Bet she's too busy with her grandkids. Futari's a mama now, after all.

1330;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Wow, you're pretty messed up, too!
1331;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-S-Sorry. I lost my head.
1332;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;That's okay. I kinda like it. By the way, what were ya doing?
1333;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A-Actually... Lorem ipsum, yada yada, etc etc, blah blah blah...
1334;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Ah, I see! I never knew you lived such a tragic life!
1335;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She's really sympathetic!
1336;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Selling tickets is so hard. I really struggled with it at the start too!
1337;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah, it really is...
1338;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Okay, since you saved my life, I'm gonna put some skin in the game. Now, prepare yourself. You and I are gonna... play a street concert, right here and now!
1339;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Street concert?
1340;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Yeah! You've got those flyers, after all. The best way to sell tickets is to play on the street and pick up an audience.
1341;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-But...
1342;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Seems there's some kind of festival in the area today, so there's lots of people around. Perfect for a street performance! Oh, but we don't have amps and stuff...
1343;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;T-Too bad! Guess we'll have to try another time...
1344;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;H-Hey, it's me! Yeah, I'm not dead! I was gonna play on the street, so could you bring the stuff by for that? Nah, the equipment's enough.
1345;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Wh-What do I do? She's really going for it...
1346;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Yeah. Sure, thanks! Hey, everyone! We're about to play! It's free, so come by if you can! Hey, Kanazawa-Hakkei peeps! We're about to play! Come watch!
1347;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wow! I can't wait!
1348;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;You're playing, girl!
1349;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Huh? You've never played outside before? If you're that scared, you could shut your eyes... Or... Well, I guess you're
1350;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, that might just work...
1351;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;scared of strangers, huh? I feel you.
1352;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I've been playing so long in the dark where I can't see my fingers anyway. Yeah. I can do it.
1353;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;But just so you know... You're not in combat with the people in front of you. Don't get it twisted who your enemies are.
1354;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Enemies? What does she mean, enemies?
1355;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What? What's Gotoh-san like at school?
1356;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah. I think I can kind of picture it, but... well...
1357;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Is she a loner at school, too?
1358;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Don't just say it like that!
1359;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Well, let me see... We're in different classes, so I don't see what she's like with her classmates, but... It's true that I've never seen her with another person. Oh, she's not being bullied or anything, though.
1360;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's good to hear!
1361;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;She's really withdrawn and people seem to have trouble interacting with her. It's kind of hard to know how to approach her.
1362;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Really?
1363;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Talk;But Bocchi's so fun.
1364;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I know, right?! She'll stick with me for guitar practice, but when I invite her to have lunch with my friends, she won't come, and she's never in her classroom... She's...
1365;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Inner Voice;Bocchi-chan... I sure hope she's okay...
1366;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Okay, we're starting! We're playing an original song by her band, Kessoku Band! Let's have some applause! Go on, play.
1367;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;R-Right... She's ad-libbing, but she's really selling it. Her playing is so confident. She's giving me such a firm foundation to play from. Just from hearing her play, I can tell she's having fun. By comparison, I... I wonder if they're all laughing at me out there. I'm too scared to look up.
1368;1;6;Eight Views;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;You're doing great! Hey, what are you doing? Well... The guitar girl seemed nervous, so it just came out. Just came out?
1369;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I see. I never had any enemies here. It was just my imagination.
1370;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Inner Voice;She opened her eyes. Her playing is suddenly more stable. So this is how Hitori-chan plays. Interesting. That's right. The only people here are the ones who stopped to hear you play. Realizing and conquering her flaws in such a short time... Amazing! She's going to get better. My instinct never lies!
1371;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;They're all smiling. If I do more concerts, will I see more faces like these? I think I'd like that.
1372;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Great work, Hitori-chan!
1373;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you.
1374;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-Thank you. Wh-What a relief... She didn't realize I only had one eye open!
1375;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;What's wrong?
1376;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, n-nothing...
1377;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, n-nothing... Sorry. I can't change everything all at once!
1378;1;6;Eight Views;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;Excuse me.
1379;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes?!
1380;1;6;Eight Views;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;Can we buy tickets to this concert? We'll take two!
1381;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Isn't that great, Hitori-chan? Huh? Did you freeze up from joy? Um... That'll be 1,500 yen apiece, 3,000 total! Right?
1382;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes! A-Are you sure you want to buy those t-t-tickets?
1383;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Give it up already, Hitori-chan!
1384;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-But I...
1385;1;6;Eight Views;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;This was my first time watching a street performance, but you were so good! Keep up the good work at your next concert, okay?
1386;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right... I'll do my best.
1387;1;6;Eight Views;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;Will you be playing that song again?
1388;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes. I will.
1389;1;6;Eight Views;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;Can't wait to see it!
1390;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Inner Voice;To think I had this shining period myself once... Tonight, I drown away my cares.
1391;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wh-Why are you crying?
1392;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Sorry, sorry! I'll be back in my happiness spiral soon...
1393;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-That can't possibly be good for you.
1394;1;6;Eight Views;Police;Talk;Excuse me. You guys can't play here!
1395;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Sorry!
1396;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-It's the fuzz! Are they gonna take me away?!
1397;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Of course not! They are pretty mad, though, so let's call it quits here.
1398;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, that's right. I got so carried away before, but I still have one ticket left to sell... B-But I did sell four! Not bad for my first time!
1399;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;I'll buy that last one. The ticket. That'll get you to your quota, right?
1400;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You're sure?!
1401;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Of course. I typically operate out of Shinjuku, so I'm close by, and I know this club too.
1402;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you so much...
1403;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;A concert costing over five Onikoros... It'd better be worth it!
1404;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
1405;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Let's play together again some time! Bye-bye, Hitori-chan!
1406;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What a mysterious person. Rockers really are... cool.
1407;1;6;Eight Views;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;I spent the last of my money on your ticket! Can I borrow some for the train? I'll pay you back at the concert.
1408;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;This feels strangely familiar. Why are rockers all so poor?
1409;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Message;I'm sorry I didn't make it to practice today. Also... I sold all my tickets!
1410;1;6;Eight Views;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm sorry I didn't make it to practice today. Also... I sold all my tickets! And... send! May our concert be a big success!
1411;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Also, I sold all my tickets," she said!
1412;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan... She's totally lying, right?
1413;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Totally.
1414;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I bet our LOINEs really did put pressure on her.
1415;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Poor thing.
1416;1;6;Eight Views;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's all be nice to her at practice tomorrow!
1417;1;6;Eight Views;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sure.
1418;1;6;Eight Views;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Right!
1419;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So hot! Summer's in full swing, huh?
1420;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Very much so! I think we're almost at Gotoh-san's house.
1421;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Great! Thanks for showing me around, by the way.
1422;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Not at all! I'm really looking forward to this!
1423;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah! It'll be such a new experience! I mean, we mainly only get together at Starry, right?
1424;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yes! I wonder what Gotoh-san's house is like!
1425;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;She said something about a cramped cardboard box reminding her of home...
1426;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;A house like a cardboard box?
1427;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan says the funniest things, huh? I can't wait!
1428;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Neither can I! I brought some sweets and a movie I like.
1429;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey! You didn't forget why we're doing this, did you?
1430;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;No, I remember! We're designing T-shirts for our concert, right?
1431;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah!
1432;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I wish Ryo-senpai could've come too...
1433;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I did invite her, but... She says her grandma took a turn for the worse.
1434;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Is she all right?!
1435;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, she's fine. This is like the tenth critical time for her grandma this year.
1436;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I love the way the guitar comes in here.
1437;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You mean...
1438;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I mean, at least her grandma really exists. That's a heckuva low bar.
1439;1;7;To Your House;Students;Talk;Let's hang out!
1440;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Once, when some classmates invited her to hang out with them...
1441;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sorry, my dog Pe'z has to have surgery.
1442;1;7;To Your House;Students;Talk;What?!
1443;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So she said, but she's never even had a dog.
1444;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;She hasn't?
1445;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;She hasn't! Then there's "I just got a call from my twin sister separated at birth," and "my dad was in a car crash, and now he has amnesia." Just all the silliest excuses...
1446;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm impressed by how easily she comes up with such a wide range of lies. Senpai's amazing! I love me a bad girl!
1447;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's a serious Ryo obsession right there.
1448;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We're here! This is it! This... is it, isn't it?
1449;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It... does say "Kessoku Band," right?
1450;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Did she mention her house was a ryokan?
1451;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm not sure. It just looks like a normal house to me.
1452;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah.
1453;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Anyway...
1454;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We're here, Bocchi-chan!
1455;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hello!
1456;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Coming! Y-Yaaaay! W-W-Welcome!
1457;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Are you having fun, Bocchi-chan?
1458;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah... I b-b-bombed...
1459;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Isn't that nice? Gotoh-san's made it clear how much she's been looking forward to this too!
1460;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Kita-san knows the kindest words to soothe my bombed soul.
1461;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Kita-san knows the kindest words to soothe my bombed soul. C-Come in.
1462;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay!
1463;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Coming in!
1464;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, these are for you. Please enjoy them with your family.
1465;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wh-What? Th-Thank you...
1466;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Wh-What? Th-Thank you... Ah, t-trendiness emanates from the bag! shining smells so good
1467;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I brought a movie, too!
1468;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I told you, we have to figure out our T-shirt design for the concert!
1469;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Rather than just wearing whatever, wouldn't having matching outfits create a sense of one-ness? A sense of band-ness?! Am I wrong here? Besides...
1470;1;7;To Your House;Seika Ijichi;Talk;There's nothing tying you guys together.
1471;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I know that's what she'll say! You get it? We're not here to play around!
1472;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-This way... I-I'm sorry. I'll put it all away.
1473;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;W-Well, we could play around a little!
1474;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yes, I'd love that!
1475;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;W-Well then, I'll fetch the drinks. Please make yourselves at home.
1476;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Thanks!
1477;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But wow, she really went all-out with the decorations!
1478;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;There's nothing here besides the guitar and effects unit, though.
1479;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah...
1480;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I just assumed her room would have a bit more of a rock feel to— Is this... rock?
1481;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, it's pretty rock! I w-wonder if there's anything else rock about i— Ow!
1482;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Huh? Why does she have so many copies of our ProPho?
1483;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I don't know what's going on, but it seems pretty darn rock!
1484;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;She's got blown-up ones too! She had this picture stuck up all over her room. She said she really liked it! But Mom told her to take them down because they were hurting her eyes. And we put those seals up when Sis was possessed before! That should just about cover it!
1485;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Wait, are you Gotoh-san's sister?
1486;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Yes! A pleasure to meet you. I'm Futari Gotoh. The dog's Jimihen.
1487;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I hope barley tea's okay. Or would they prefer a trendier drink?
1488;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So cute!
1489;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;So cute!
1490;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Sorry to keep you guys wa—
1491;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Hey, will you play the Munions song on guitar?
1492;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'll practice so I can do it the next time I come by.
1493;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;You gotta! When's the next time you come by?
1494;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I-Is this...
1495;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Jimihen's a friendly little guy!
1496;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-They're getting along so well, there's no room left for me...
1497;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Huh? Bocchi-chan?
1498;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san?
1499;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;A five-year-old and a dog have better social skills than me.
1500;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Sis is frozen up again.
1501;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;F-Futari. Wh-What are you doing here? Wh-Where are Mom and Dad?
1502;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Shopping.
1503;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I-I've got grown-up things to talk about, so please go play with Jimihen.
1504;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Aw, no fun!
1505;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I don't mind having Futari-chan here.
1506;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, same!
1507;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Y-Y-You can't! I c-c-can't whoop it up if my sister's here!
1508;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, you've been whooping it up with us all this time?
1509;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I beg of you! Please go play with Jimihen! You can have an ice pop from the freezer.
1510;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Well, it is what it is!
1511;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You've got such a sisterly bond!
1512;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;How did you get that from what just happened?
1513;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Now, let's design those T-shirts! Feel free to use these!
1514;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay!
1515;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Okay...
1516;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We could just slap our logo on there, but I'd love to sell the shirts as merch, too!
1517;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;N-Nijika-chan is so hungry for merch!
1518;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So if you have any other great ideas, I might use those as well!
1519;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay! Let's do our best, Gotoh-san!
1520;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
1521;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;R-Right! I have to impress the others for once!
1522;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;C'mon, take that stuff off before you try to look serious!
1523;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;What? They really came?
1524;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Really? For real?
1525;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Yeah!
1526;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;These friends aren't just the imaginary kind?
1527;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Yeah, yeah!
1528;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;All done!
1529;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let me see!
1530;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;The concept is friendship, effort, and victory!
1531;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's not a dang sports festival!
1532;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Aw, but I think it's cute!
1533;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hang on. What are we winning at? I'm not sure how "victory" applies to a concert...
1534;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Um... vibes!
1535;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Vibes?
1536;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I just think wearing these would really get us feeling like a unit! Right, Gotoh-sa—
1537;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Class unity...
1538;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! Is the idea of a sports festival that traumatic for you?!
1539;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The sports festival: the number one-source of school trauma for introverts. School Trauma Sources for Introverts 1st Place (Based on Japanese Introvert Society Poll) A heinous ritual in which those with no athletic ability are shunned, and even their right to exist is stripped away. Not only during school hours, but afterward too, they are forced to perform slave labor, creating banners and practicing cheers! One for all! All for one! One for all! All for one! An entire month's torturous existence living for naught but the sports festival! One for all! All for one!
1540;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Looks like Gotoh-san melted.
1541;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It sure is hot today!
1542;1;7;To Your House;Post-Apocalypse Classmates;Imagination;No cooperation, no life!
1543;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;But the true terror lurking behind every sports festival...
1544;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Wow, this week's Bocchi Time lasted through the whole commercial break!
1545;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Did I do something wrong?
1546;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You've really put your foot in it now, Kita-chan!
1547;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What? Come back, Gotoh-san!
1548;1;7;To Your House;Post-Apocalypse Classmates;Imagination;No cooperation, no life!
1549;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;A place in which introverts are constantly underfoot, but if they just sit quietly in a corner, they're persecuted for not being team players!
1550;1;7;To Your House;Post-Apocalypse Hooligan;Imagination;Death to those who bring down the sports festival mood!
1551;1;7;To Your House;Post-Apocalypse Classmates;Imagination;No cooperation, no life! No cooperation, no life!
1552;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;See? They really exist!
1553;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hello!
1554;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Thanks for having us!
1555;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Isn't it wonderful? I never imagined Hitori would have real friends over!
1556;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Eat your fill, all right?
1557;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sure!
1558;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thanks so much!
1559;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;You let Hitori join your band, right?
1560;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yes.
1561;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We didn't exactly "let" her join. I asked her to join, and she was willing to humor me.
1562;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Really?
1563;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;See? Music really brings people together! Right, Jimihen?
1564;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;She doesn't cause too much trouble with her retreats into her own little world, does she?
1565;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Aw, that's no trouble at all!
1566;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah! It's fun!
1567;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Nice to hear.
1568;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Here, it's done.
1569;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The fact that I'm still upset about school festivals makes me realize I'm a downer even more, which made everything worse...
1570;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Karaage's done!
1571;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Wow, that looks good!
1572;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Wow, that looks good!
1573;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;That one is soy sauce with garlic, and this one is shio koji. And there's lemon and shichimi spice to taste.
1574;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thanks!
1575;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, eat!
1576;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay!
1577;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;When she said she had friends coming, I assumed they were imaginary or hallucinations, but then, she did have that picture...
1578;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hallucinations?
1579;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;But of course, image editing software is pretty sophisticated these days...
1580;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Software?
1581;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;If I might ask, you're not from some kind of friend rental servi—
1582;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We're her bona fide bandmates!
1583;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Oh, okay.
1584;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I can't say it doesn't sound like something I'd do... but hearing Mom and Dad's ideas about me is so...
1585;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;It's just that Hitori's never brought a friend home before.
1586;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Inner Voice;So Bocchi's like this even at home.
1587;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;She's been so restless for days now. She said something about practicing decorating her room, put it all up, took it all down, and put it back up, over and over again.
1588;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;And she played a simulated game of Twister, just in case you played.
1589;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;M-Mom! Dad! You don't have to tell them all that stuff!
1590;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;I'm glad we went shopping just in case!
1591;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Okay, this is a day worth remembering! A friend-a-versary!
1592;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Friend-a-versity!
1593;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Cut it out already!
1594;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;That's right. The job she said she'd gotten...
1595;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, it's at my sister's club. Bocchi-chan mainly serves drinks to customers.
1596;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;T-To customers?!
1597;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;T-To customers?!
1598;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah!
1599;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It does feel pretty weird to have friends at my house...
1600;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Am I dreaming?
1601;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Amazing. Music really does cause personal growth!
1602;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;And you were having so much fun when we burst in like that! I'm so sorry.
1603;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Maybe we should butt out?
1604;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Hey, hey, Kita-chan! What's this?
1605;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That's my favorite heartwarming movie!
1606;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I've always wanted to watch that one!
1607;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Wanna watch it all together?
1608;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Yes, please!
1609;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Great idea! What fun!
1610;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;Yeah! So fun! So fun! Yeah!
1611;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I don't know why, but... it feels kind of hard to go back in now...
1612;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;We ended up watching the movie, playing games, and having nothing but fun.
1613;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Twister and Tycoon were so much fun to play!
1614;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah! So much fun! And yet...
1615;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That's right! We still need to design our T-shirts for the concert. Oh, wait... Senpai! Gotoh-san's back to it!
1616;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, I know why. Watching that heartwarming seishun movie has her back in a spiral.
1617;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I did it again?!
1618;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Heartwarming seishun movies: the number-one source of movie trauma for introverts, by genre. Traumatic Movie Genres for Introverts 1st Place (Based on Japanese Introvert Society Poll)
1619;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! We're running out of time! Snap out of it!
1620;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A-An ordinary girl has two hot guys trying to win her heart... But if someone that cute is "ordinary," what hope is there for me?
1621;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san!
1622;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's hopeless.
1623;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ryo sent in a bunch of design ideas!
1624;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Let me see! I want to see!
1625;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;C'mon! Look with us, Bocchi-chan! Wh-What in the world?
1626;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Curry? Now sushi...
1627;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I don't get it.
1628;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Which should I have for dinner? Fried Rice Ramen Set
1629;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Make your own decisions!
1630;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I think curry's better!
1631;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, don't actually respond!
1632;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;E-Excuse me...
1633;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, Bocchi-chan's back?
1634;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes... I thought you might like to see my design... What do you think?
1635;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Inner Voice;S-So lame!
1636;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-Is it too trendy?
1637;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;It's that mystery font I see on middle school boys' clothing all the time.
1638;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I thought it would keep people focused on our clothing when we're playing.
1639;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, for several reasons.
1640;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What's the point of all the zippers and chains?
1641;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I thought I could use the zippers to hold picks, and the chain could serve as a guitar strap.
1642;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Weirdly practical!
1643;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;So, can I assume we're all in on this one?
1644;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm not sure about that...
1645;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Is this what you like to wear normally?
1646;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;My mom buys my clothes, so no.
1647;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, really?
1648;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I've never worn any of them, though... They're not to my taste.
1649;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Aw, I wanna see!
1650;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Same! I've never seen you in anything but the tracksuit!
1651;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;C'mon, please! Try one on!
1652;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!
1653;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!
1654;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;F-Fine...
1655;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah!
1656;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah!
1657;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;She's so... C-Cute!
1658;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;She's so... C-Cute! I love it! Look right this way!
1659;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No pictures, please...
1660;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I knew it! Bocchi-chan's cute!
1661;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It's easy to forget, with how she usually is!
1662;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;U-Um... c-can I take it off now?
1663;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Wait, hang on!
1664;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I know! Let's brush back your bangs! That's what you need!
1665;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Are you growing them out?
1666;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I j-just can't get to the salon, so they grow out...
1667;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Then I'll do some styling!
1668;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No, thank you!
1669;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Aw, don't be shy! Bocchi-chan's turning to ash! Her body can't keep up with the sudden stress of her face being exposed! Bocchi-chan's... dead.
1670;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We'll have to find a new guitarist. Senpai! What's wrong?
1671;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm suddenly so dizzy... The room is so damp all of a sudden, like all the air's been sucked out of it... I breathed it in!
1672;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;S-So did I!
1673;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I-It's no use. G-Going limp...
1674;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Is this... Gotoh-san's curse?
1675;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Would anyone like dessert?
1676;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;We've got the sweets Kita-chan brought—
1677;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Inner Voice;I'm sorry for trying to push through everything with positivity.
1678;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;I'm sorry I couldn't get good at guitar. I'm sorry for being too cute.
1679;1;7;To Your House;Futari Gotou;Talk;They're all acting like Sis!
1680;1;7;To Your House;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Dear, the salt and the seals!
1681;1;7;To Your House;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Should I call that exorcist?
1682;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Message;You'll have to do the concert yourself.
1683;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Why?
1684;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;And so... Since nobody had any good ideas, we're going with my T-shirt design!
1685;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Ta-dah.
1686;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I love it! Did you make this, Ijichi-senpai?!
1687;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm pretty good at the design stuff!
1688;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Then why didn't you just design it from the start?
1689;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan. You look like you were just thinking, Then why didn't you just design it from the start?
1690;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She's psychic!
1691;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm getting pretty good at guessing what you're thinking lately!
1692;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Awesome! Our ties feel so much stronger now!
1693;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah, I love it!
1694;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;The quality of the model helps.
1695;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Totally! Senpai, look right here!
1696;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;This is pretty good, though. Two days to our concert. And we worked hard to make our ties feel...
1697;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, looks like there's a typhoon on the way.
1698;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No way! This is the first I've heard of it!
1699;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Summer weather is so fickle.
1700;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Seriously?
1701;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-But what about the concert?
1702;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Should we make rain charms?
1703;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah! That's our only choice! Your quota is ten each!
1704;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
1705;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, it looks like it won't hit the Kanto region, though.
1706;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, really? Whew, that's a relief!
1707;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I can't wait for the show!
1708;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah.
1709;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I think the new song's coming together pretty well!
1710;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;U-Um...
1711;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah! We're all sounding awesome!
1712;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay, let's get practicing!
1713;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Excuse me! Sh-Shouldn't we still make the rain charms? Just to be safe?
1714;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, sure! Better safe than sorry, right?
1715;1;7;To Your House;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Totally!
1716;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'll bring in what we need to make them.
1717;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;O-Okay!
1718;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I haven't made rain charms since elementary school!
1719;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm used to being negative, so I always assume the worst, but...
1720;1;7;To Your House;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sorry, the five younger brothers I haven't seen since birth—
1721;1;7;To Your House;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Stop acting above it! It was your idea! You okay, Bocchi-chan?
1722;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes!
1723;1;7;To Your House;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Y-Y-Y-Y-Yes! It'll be okay... I think.
1724;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I hate it when I'm right.
1725;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Nijika and her friends made them.
1726;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;PA-san;Talk;But the typhoon still came in the end.
1727;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Well, it's not like rain charms actually affect the weather.
1728;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;PA-san;Talk;Even the people who bought tickets might not come at this rate. I hope they're not too heartbroken by the small crowd. They practiced so hard for this. I feel bad for them.
1729;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Real bands get screwed over by life all the time. They need to learn to make it through any situation.
1730;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;PA-san;Talk;I've got a handkerchief.
1731;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, go away.
1732;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Looks like my friends can't come either.
1733;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Same with my parents. M-My grandma was supposed to look after Futari, b-but now she can't come, so...
1734;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah. Makes sense...
1735;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Our audience is going to be less than half of what we expected.
1736;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well, it is what it is! Let's take it in stride!
1737;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yes, of course!
1738;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Nijika-chan always stays so cheerful, no matter what happens.
1739;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;C'mon, look alive there!
1740;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's the low-pressure system. So sleepy...
1741;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;That's right. Even during the concert where I was just helping... She worked so hard to cheer me up when I was scared. O-Okay! For today's concert... I'm gonna bring the hype!
1742;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, this is a serious concert. No messing around.
1743;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You really like that outfit, huh?
1744;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes...
1745;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Wow, look at that rain! Bocchi-chan, I'm here!
1746;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;M-Ma'am!
1747;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, you came here for Bocchi-chan?
1748;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Heck yeah! Yay!
1749;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You know each other?
1750;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;She was my junior in college.
1751;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Betcher havin' an afterparty tonight, right? Picked an izakaya yet?
1752;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You reek of booze!
1753;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;I know a good one, 'kay? 'Kay?
1754;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;How did you become even more of a pain in the ass?
1755;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;PA-san;Talk;She's got that pain-in-the-ass quality that college students have when they'd just learned something new.
1756;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;And look at you! You're soaked!
1757;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;I'm so wet! Hitori-chan!
1758;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;The girls from our street concert! Y-You really came?
1759;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;Of course we did! We're your fans! We'll be expecting a performance powerful enough to blow away the typhoon!
1760;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Fans...
1761;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;Y-You are Hitori-chan, right? Did we have the wrong person?
1762;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;My fans!
1763;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Guitar man;Talk;Congrats! Congrats! Congrats!
1764;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Microphone man;Talk;Congrats! Congrats! Congrats!
1765;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;My fans!
1766;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;It is the wrong person!
1767;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Looks like the rain's only going to get worse.
1768;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Worse than this?
1769;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yes...
1770;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Maybe we should just stream it as a no-audience concert and act like it was supposed to be that way from the start.
1771;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We're not doing that! It's way too late to get anyone to tune in, and we've already got a couple people here...
1772;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I-I-It'll be okay! A-As long as we have p-people waiting to see us p-perform!
1773;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Don't you dare! She's evolved somehow...
1774;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It's just about start time, and there's really not many people out there...
1775;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But the other bands' fans are here too, and I'm sure they'll all listen to us!
1776;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;And I'm sure more will arrive if we start.
1777;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Concertgoer;Talk;Hey, you ever heard of this first group? Kessoku Band? Don't know. Don't care. Yeah, seems like a waste of time.
1778;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;W-Well, we're new, so of course no one knows us! Don't let it get you down!
1779;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;E-Exactly!
1780;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Don't sweat it. Don't sweat it.
1781;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
1782;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;O-Okay, it's almost time! Let's do that concert, you guys!
1783;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;A pleasure to meet you! We're Kessoku Band! We appreciate your kind attendance in spite of this awful weather!
1784;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, that's way too polite for a rock band!
1785;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I want my mango box! Actually, I want to disappear altogether!
1786;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Well, let's get to that first song! Please lend your ears to our original song: Guitar, Solitude, and the Blue Planet!
1787;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Nijika-chan's drumming feels a little slow. And Kita-san's making mistakes she didn't make in practice. Ryo-san and Nijika-chan aren't in sync at all. We're not playing the way we usually do...
1788;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That was "Guitar, Solitude, and the Blue Planet"!
1789;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Concertgoer;Talk;Yeah, what a waste of time. We should've showed up later.
1790;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Um...
1791;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, you need to introduce the next song!
1792;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;R-Right! The next is another of our original songs, and it's one we just wrote...
1793;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Our performance and our songs still aren't good enough. But... I refuse to let it stay this way!
1794;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Concertgoer;Talk;Hey, not bad! Yeah!
1795;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;That was super cool! Yeah!
1796;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Magnificent smugface.
1797;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That was our second song, "That Band"! Now, here's our last song!
1798;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Nice work on the concert. This is all on my tab, so drink up.
1799;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Thanks, Sis! Though we don't drink...
1800;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Love ya, Senpai!
1801;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You pay your own way. Get off.
1802;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Who exactly is this woman, if I may ask?
1803;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Genius bassist and unparalleled bass-lover, Kikuri Hiroi! I left my bass at a drinking party yesterday, but I forgot which drinking party, so...
1804;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Instant self-contradiction.
1805;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I've been to a lot of your concerts.
1806;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Aw, for real? You got good taste, hon!
1807;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You spray booze on the audience.
1808;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Blind drunk concerts are the best! Sorry, forgot the words! But hey, that's how concerts go sometimes! Don't be mad, you jerks!
1809;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I treasure my memory of you stepping on my face.
1810;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Thank you, Shinjuku! I love you mother******s!
1811;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;There's so much about rock I have yet to learn.
1812;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It might be okay not to learn all that.
1813;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Glad your concert turned out well in the end!
1814;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;For an audience of ten, sure.
1815;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;But every single one of 'em left happy!
1816;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, guess so!
1817;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Well, keep it up, and you'll pick up fans. Work hard for your next concert. And make sure you pay your quota fee.
1818;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That'd be really inspiring without the last bit...
1819;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You worked really hard today too, Bocchi-chan... Wait, why's she a husk?!
1820;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, don't turn to ash!
1821;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I've grown so tired...
1822;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Guitar man;Talk;Congrats! Congrats!
1823;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Microphone man;Talk;Congrats! Congrats!
1824;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;That's the wrong show! Go on, order as much food as you like!
1825;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right...
1826;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Watcha gettin', Bocchi-chan? I was thinking of ordering karaage!
1827;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sounds good...
1828;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;What are you doing?
1829;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But this looks pretty good too!
1830;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Isstagramming! I'm the minister!
1831;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Minister? What do you like so much about that, anyway?
1832;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What? I guess it's like giving people a piece of the fun... Isn't everything more fun when you share it with your friends?
1833;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;What? I guess it's like giving people a piece of the fun... Isn't everything more fun when you share it with your friends? Kit-aura!
1834;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nice! Use that Kita-chan power of yours to purge my sister's twisted spirit!
1835;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Twisted? But the manager's really nice!
1836;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;Twisted? But the manager's really nice! Kit-aura! Kit-aura!
1837;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Stop it. You're killing me.
1838;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I've made up my mind. Here's the menu.
1839;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thanks! Let's see... I'll have the avocado and cream cheese pinchos! And the Spanish omelette with hollandaise sauce!
1840;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;The what?
1841;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Here! The omelette with hollandaise.
1842;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Hollanda-what?
1843;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Kita-san's so fluent in trendy gibberish.
1844;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nice! Nice! Keep ordering!
1845;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I bet she can casually walk into a Starpucks. I bet she could make the most complicated orders like it was nothing.
1846;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Imagination;I'll have the puri-puri pepero papipupepo peroppe pacina shortcake! Kit-aura!
1847;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan? What do you want?
1848;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh... I w-won't be the way I usually am! I'll make a trendy choice too!
1849;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan?
1850;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Then, I'll have the M-Machu Picchu Ruins, Mississippi River, Grand Canyon San Diego hash...
1851;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;M-Machu Picchu, Machu Picchu, Machu Picchu... Where's that exactly?
1852;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, I read it wrong... I meant fries.
1853;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;How did you read that wrong?
1854;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Pickled fish offals for me.
1855;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;How old're you again?
1856;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You're already moving on?
1857;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Izakayas are like my home ground, y'know?
1858;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, how do you read this one?
1859;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Which one? I don't think I can read it either...
1860;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You're so knowledgeable, Ryo-senpai!
1861;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's my first time at an izakaya, but they're actually kind of fun... I wonder if they'll be even more fun when I grow up and can drink.
1862;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 1;Talk;My wife's taste in clothing changed all of a sudden. And she suddenly started locking her smartphone.
1863;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 2;Talk;What, you check your wife's phone?
1864;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 1;Talk;No, I just happened to notice.
1865;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 2;Talk;Sounds like cheating to me.
1866;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 1;Talk;Yeah, gotta be... But maybe I deserve it. I'm so busy with work every day...
1867;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 2;Talk;You don't deserve it.
1868;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 1;Talk;Hours of unpaid overtime, forced to spend my days off golfing with clients... And when I do get an early break, I have such a hard time facing her I go drinking with you instead... What am I even doing all this work for?
1869;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 2;Talk;Hey, you all right, man?
1870;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 1;Talk;Sometimes I look at the station platform and I find myself about to throw myself onto the tracks.
1871;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Salary men 2;Talk;C'mon, have some more to drink. Excuse me! More shochu!
1872;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Bartender;Talk;Sure thing! One shochu!
1873;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Is life just an unrelenting hell? If I can't make my stage debut in high school, I'm going to have to get a proper career too. I'm not smart enough to get into college, and I don't even know what I'd go for...
1874;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Imaginary Boss;Imagination;Your sales for this month were the lowest on the team, Gotoh-san. Gotoh-san again? It's partly the boss being cruel. He transferred her to sales to try to make her quit!
1875;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;E-Excuse me... W-Would you like to buy some tokoroten? It's well-aged, and it goes down smooth... I see as plain as day where my Game of Life is going!
1876;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Michiyo Gotou;Imagination;Hitori-chan, won't you open up? Please? You don't have to go back to work. Just come eat dinner with me again! Please?
1877;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1878;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Another of Bocchi-chan's episodes?
1879;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Oh, so that is typical for her!
1880;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;If I can't make money with my guitar, I'll end up a NEET. If I can't make money with my guitar...
1881;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Her face is scary when it gets like that.
1882;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;PA-san;Talk;Really? I think it's got personality.
1883;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Are you for real?
1884;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sandpaper, please.
1885;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It's kind of a chore, huh?
1886;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Whoops. Think I botched it.
1887;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It's okay. Just do it like this. See?
1888;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;They're used to it!
1889;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Up we go. Did I make her face too long?
1890;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I think it's about right.
1891;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, thank you!
1892;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;A-Actually can I fix it up a little?
1893;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;By the way, Ikuyo. You played pretty well today for only having done this for three months.
1894;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Huh? Who's Ikuyo again?
1895;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Dunno! Who'd have a crummy old name like that?!
1896;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;It's your name, isn't it?!
1897;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Oh, it's Kita-chan's name?
1898;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;PA-san;Talk;That face is contagious, huh?
1899;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I hid it for so long! I hate my name so much!
1900;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;How come? It's cute.
1901;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You wouldn't understand, since you have a beautiful name that means "song of the stars"!
1902;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Look at her freak out!
1903;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But mine sounds like a bad pun! Kita! Ikuyo! (I'm here! Let's go!) Are you serious?!
1904;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I think we broke her.
1905;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;My full name is Kita Kita.
1906;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Seeing you withdraw into your shell is fun.
1907;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You're sadistic.
1908;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;So, as for what you were saying before... You were mumbling about supporting yourself with the guitar and becoming a NEET.
1909;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I'm sorry for losing my head...
1910;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Hey, nothin' wrong with it. But lemme give you some advice as your senpai in the world of bands. Just chill out and enjoy yourself!
1911;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;PA-san;Talk;If you put the weight of success on your own shoulders all the time, you'll just make yourself miserable.
1912;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;That's right. It's important to enjoy the process of making your dream come true.
1913;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;By the way, Senpai, how come you suddenly quit playing?
1914;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-The manager was in a band?
1915;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Oh, yah. They were super popular.
1916;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Then wh-why...
1917;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I got sick of bands.
1918;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;But you run a club. What's the deal there, huh?
1919;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Shut up and drink.
1920;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;What, I can? Thanks a bunch!
1921;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Nijika-chan never said a word about that... Huh? And Nijika-chan's been gone a while...
1922;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I'm not paying for you, though.
1923;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Aww...
1924;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;E-Excuse me. I have to use the restroom.
1925;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Manager, keep 'em comin'!
1926;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;E-Excuse me... Nijika-chan?
1927;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, Bocchi-chan!
1928;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-Is something the matter?
1929;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nah, just getting some fresh air.
1930;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-It's been getting cold at night lately, huh?
1931;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sure has. Next thing we know, summer break's gonna be over!
1932;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I hear nothing. I know nothing. Summer break never ends. I'm not a student. Trees, water, planets, Milky Way...
1933;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! Back to reality!
1934;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sorry. E-Excuse me...
1935;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Say... I realized something while I was watching you play today. You're guitarhero, aren't you?
1936;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;W-Well, a-actually, n-no, about that...
1937;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It was pretty obvious from the on-point way you were strumming. And I finally noticed you had the same guitar.
1938;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;No use trying to hide it now.
1939;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;No use trying to hide it now. Um... I am. B-But I didn't hide it on purpose. S-Since I'm anything but a hero right now... I w-wanted to wait to tell you until I fixed the way I am. E-Especially you, Nijika-chan. A-Are you shocked to find out?
1940;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nah... It made me all the more happy to have you!
1941;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;What?
1942;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;See, I told you I had a dream before, right?
1943;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes?
1944;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;My mom died when I was little, and my dad was never home, so my sister was pretty much my only family. But since I hated being alone, when my sis started a band, I had her take me to her clubs all the time. It all seemed so shining to me. I was never happier anywhere else. I was her inspiration for quitting her band and starting up this club. Starry is a place my sister made for me. Though I'll bet she won't admit it. So my real dream is to make a band popular enough for me and my sister and make Starry even more famous! But when I actually started my band, I spent a while thinking that it was kind of out of my reach. And everyone was so disheartened today. But every time things are looking their worst, you're the one who breaks through it for us! Bocchi-chan, you were one heck of a hero to me today. Ryo wants to use this band to finally get to play music from the heart, and Kita-chan wants to really do something with us. They've all invested their hopes in the band. That reminds me, you never actually told me what you were doing the band for now.
1945;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... As a guitarist, I want to make the Kessoku Band we all care so much about the best band it can be! A-And I want us to become such a popular band that we can make money and not have to finish school...
1946;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's a pretty tall order! But I accept your investment! I sure do wish you could play the way you do in your videos every time, though...
1947;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'll d-do my best...
1948;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But now I know it for sure! Having you with us will make our dreams possible! So keep showing us more and more. Of "Bocchi-chan's rock." Bocchi the Rock!
1949;1;8;Bocchi the Rock;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Okay!
1950;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Kessoku Band managed to succeed in its first full four-member concert. And so, our summer came to... a middle. That's right. We do have some break left, don't we? Until my summer break comes to an end...
1951;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;What lovely weather!
1952;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm going to spend every single day enjoying it to its fullest.
1953;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Futari Gotou;Talk;Shake!
1954;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Another fulfilling day... Not! It's summer break, but I'm not doing a single thing differently! I mean, playing guitar is fun and all, but... I was thinking Kessoku Band might hang out together, so I've cleared my schedule of everything but work, but... Of course, it's usually clear regardless, but... B-But keeping it clear has a totally different feel, right? Still, even at work, nobody so much as suggests hanging out...
1955;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! See you at work again tomorrow!
1956;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The members of a band usually hang out, don't they? But I guess when we're all available, we should be practicing... S-Still, just for once, I'd like to... Yeah, that's right! I can't always be passive! B-But if I bring it up, I'm the one who'll have to pick the place and time... I can't think of a plan that'll satisfy everyone! But I just have to work up the courage! I'll start with Nijika-chan! Well... It's a bit late to call now. A-Anyway, there's a lot of summer break left! I'm sure one of them will make the offer sooner or later.
1957;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Hitori-chan! Time to eat!
1958;1;9;Enoshima Escar;TV;Talk;What is the general theory of relativity? The general theory of relativity states that the passage of time slows in the presence of a powerful gravity well. Time slows due to curvature of spacetime caused by a powerful gravity well The black holes theorized to exist throughout space are believed to be the end state of the life cycle of massive stars. Their extreme density and high gravitational potential mean that not only matter, but even light, becomes trapped forever in their pull. The gravitational field causes time to slow so much that it nearly stops...
1959;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Hitori-chan! I'm coming in! I thought I'd air out the futons while the weather's nice. Don't lie around all day, all right? You'll be back at school soon.
1960;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;But I'm in a black hole.
1961;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Futari Gotou;Talk;It's done!
1962;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan? Acting strange?
1963;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah. She's been staring out into space, and she's barely talked in days.
1964;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sounds like typical Bocchi.
1965;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;C'mon, you can't possibly...
1966;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Astaxanthin. Canthaxanthin.
1967;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;...be exaggerating.
1968;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm not! She seemed on the verge of tears for a minute, but then she spontaneously started dancing the samba!
1969;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Imagination;Tortilla!
1970;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's not good!
1971;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Typical Bocchi.
1972;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It is not!
1973;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Hey. Could you get Bocchi-chan to knock it off?
1974;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Eh?
1975;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;She's been making cicada graves in front of the club all day.
1976;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;That's way too out there! What's got her freaking out like that?
1977;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I wonder if it's because today's the last day of summer break.
1978;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Farewell. Farewell.
1979;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I don't wanna go back to school either.
1980;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Say, guys. Have you actually taken her out anywhere this summer? One time, while you were working, I asked what she was doing with her time off...
1981;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan. What are you doing with your break when you're not working?
1982;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um, I... My little sister asked me to teach her guitar, so I did.
1983;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, that's nice.
1984;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-But...
1985;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Futari Gotou;Talk;Today I asked my sister to teach me to play guitar! I thought it was awesome how my sister stayed inside practicing, day after day! I have too many things to do and too many friends to play with over summer break, so I can't stay home practicing every day like her! That's why I think it's awesome!
1986;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Her words sent me into a spiral, and I ended up not getting out of bed for days.
1987;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I see.
1988;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I cleared my schedule! N-Not because I have nothing to do! I cleared it on purpose!
1989;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;R-Right.
1990;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;She said all that.
1991;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Why didn't you tell us earlier?
1992;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I wanted to invite her, but... My schedule's packed every day I'm not here, and I thought she'd be uncomfortable around people she doesn't know, so... What about you, Ijichi-senpai?
1993;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;W-Well, when we're not practicing, I'm cleaning up at home or working here, so...
1994;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;R-Ryo-senpai?
1995;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I figured you two had invited her already.
1996;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Y-You're telling me...
1997;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Nobody invited Bocchi-chan out?
1998;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nobody invited Bocchi-chan out?
1999;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Nobody invited Bocchi-chan out?
2000;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You guys need to change your band name.
2001;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;G-Gotoh-san! You want to hang out?
2002;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Docosahexaenoic acid. Eicosapentaenoic acid.
2003;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Come back to us! I know! Let's all go to the beach together, right now! We could hit up Enoshima!
2004;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Great idea! It's a straight shot from Shimo-Kita.
2005;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-But... What-about-our-practice-then?
2006;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Why's she talking like a robot?
2007;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We can practice any time! It's not like we have our next concert scheduled, anyway.
2008;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Let's use our last day of summer break to make memories together!
2009;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Memories...
2010;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Isn't that a great idea? Let's go to the beach together!
2011;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;But it might be too late to swim.
2012;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah... no point in going to the beach if you can't swim.
2013;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;B-But there's still the beach shacks!
2014;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's eat shirasu-don! And we can gaze at the ocean from the sand...
2015;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Ocean... Sand...
2016;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;See? Doesn't that sound fun?
2017;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Guitar man;Talk;Wait for me!
2018;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Guitar woman;Talk;You catch up!
2019;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Guitar man;Talk;The end of summer, huh?
2020;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Guitar woman;Talk;Let's come again next year.
2021;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Guitar man;Talk;Tropical love forever!
2022;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Tropical love...
2023;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san!
2024;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Forever...
2025;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Why is this happening?
2026;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I think I made it worse somehow.
2027;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay! Let's take her out while she's docile!
2028;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Roger!
2029;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan, you carry Bocchi-chan!
2030;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What?!
2031;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay! Let's get going to Enoshima!
2032;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah!
2033;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san! We'll be making those summer memories soon! Just hang in there a little longer!
2034;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Scary... Tropical...
2035;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm in a black hole... at the far reaches of the galaxy... Too far for the sunshine of summer to reach... Trapped by the powerful gravity...
2036;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;She must really hate school to be acting this way.
2037;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Is your school super strict?
2038;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;No, I'd say it's on the liberal side. And the culture festivals are lots of fun!
2039;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Aw, lucky! Our school's pretty strict, and the culture festivals are super uptight. It's mostly science project posters and stuff.
2040;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Really? That's right. Shimo-Kitazawa High is a prep school, isn't it? You two must be really smart!
2041;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm pretty average, myself... And Ryo is... yeah.
2042;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Eh?
2043;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You bombed your last round of tests, right?
2044;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yep.
2045;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Eh?
2046;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;She picked the school for the same reason I did: because it was close to home!
2047;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yep.
2048;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But then how did you pass the entrance exam?
2049;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ryo's a cram-the-night-before type. She worked really hard right before the exam, but apparently forgot it all after.
2050;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;When I study too hard, I forget how to play bass.
2051;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Which means Ryo-senpai isn't mysterious and thoughtful at all... No! Her brain is so small you can hear it rattling around in her skull!
2052;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Maybe we can use that sound in a new song!
2053;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Stop it! Stop destroying my fantasy!
2054;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Don't yell on the train.
2055;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm deleting this conversation from my memory!
2056;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Is this what overly strong love does to you?
2057;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Curvature of spacetime...
2058;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What are you seeing right now, Bocchi-chan?
2059;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I don't get why she's so isolated at school. She's so fun.
2060;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Right? I wish everyone at her school could see how cool she is.
2061;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'll make sure to talk to her when school starts again.
2062;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You totally should! Bocchi-chan's dream right now is to drop out of school!
2063;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Does that even count as a dream?!
2064;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Anyway, let's use today to make a fun summer memory with Bocchi-chan!
2065;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Let's take a picture, Gotoh-san!
2066;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I'm gonna get some sea salt soft-serve. See you later.
2067;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey! No one said this was free time!
2068;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san. Please wake up already! Gotoh-san!
2069;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Look! The beach is so big!
2070;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Huh? Wh-When did I...
2071;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You've really been out cold this whole time?
2072;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you, Kita-san.
2073;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Th-Thank you, Kita-san. When was the last time I've been to the beach? Now that I'm here, I can see how beautiful it—
2074;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Beach Shack Clerk;Talk;Hey, girls! Come eat at our beach shack! We got a discount for cuties like you!
2075;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I-It's a party animal in the flesh!
2076;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Beach Shack Clerk;Talk;We can get you a table for four right away! Are y'all in high school? Where'd you come from?
2077;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan exploded!
2078;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Archetypal beach bros.
2079;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;They're too powerful for us to handle!
2080;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Let's get away from the beach, ASAP!
2081;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Here, for you, Gotoh-san.
2082;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thanks... What is this?
2083;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Takosen! I hear they press the takoyaki with a full ton of force!
2084;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A ton of force? It's good!
2085;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;My tastiness sensor never fails.
2086;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;V-Very impressive!
2087;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, I'm just glad to see you feeling better!
2088;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It's so big and cute! So photogenic!
2089;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's take a picture!
2090;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay! Here comes the selfie!
2091;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Lemme see!
2092;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It turned out super great!
2093;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I ate tako senbei with them. Summer memories...
2094;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I ate tako senbei with them. Summer memories... Th-Thank you... Thank you for today. It's been wonderful.
2095;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;How are we at the climax already?!
2096;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;And so, my summer came to an end.
2097;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We're just getting started!
2098;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay! Let's climb all the way to the top!
2099;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Stairs?
2100;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Is there anything more beautiful than scenery you have to work to see?
2101;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;No. Screw that.
2102;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Let's do it!
2103;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;No!
2104;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You too, Gotoh-san! You'll come with me, right, Ijichi-senpai?
2105;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm not super into it either... Kita-chan! She's glowing more than ever!
2106;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;H-How?
2107;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;P-Perhaps her usually understated extrovert aura h-has been amplified by the light of the sun!
2108;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's stripped off her limiter, you mean?!
2109;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Come on! Let's do it! Hurry up, everyone!
2110;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;Come on! Let's do it! Hurry up, everyone! Kit-aura
2111;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I'm done. No more climbing.
2112;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan's getting further and further ahead...
2113;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm out!
2114;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Who cares about the view? Not me.
2115;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hang in there, you two. We've only just started!
2116;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Lemme take a break first.
2117;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What'll I do with you?
2118;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You've got so much energy, Kita-chan...
2119;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;E-Escar... I th-think we can ride an escalator up!
2120;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;C'mon, let's climb the stairs!
2121;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It costs money?
2122;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You need to buy tickets to the Enoshima Escar. See, we should climb the stairs instead!
2123;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Enoshima Escar Clerk;Talk;Welcome!
2124;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I... I have no money, but... I've got some pretty good bass guitars. I'll give you one.
2125;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Enoshima Escar Clerk;Talk;Um, I don't think...
2126;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;How about two? You want three?!
2127;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Enoshima Escar Clerk;Talk;You need to buy a ticket...
2128;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What a breeze!
2129;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But climbing the stairs would have made the view so much more impressive.
2130;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You'll pay me back next month, right?
2131;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I've never broken a promise in my life.
2132;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;You didn't pay me back last time, though.
2133;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sorry, Bocchi-chan! I'll take it out of her paycheck.
2134;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You're inhuman!
2135;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We made it!
2136;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;As long as we're here, let's hit up the observation deck!
2137;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Even taking the Escar is kind of exhausting.
2138;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It was... quite a long way.
2139;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yeah...
2140;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;But being up this high feels quite liberating.
2141;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;P-Positivity wells up within me.
2142;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;That's the fresh air and magnificent view at work!
2143;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Sh-Should we take a picture together?
2144;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah! Cheese!
2145;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Cheese!
2146;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;They're finally getting into it.
2147;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Girlfriend;Talk;Look! Isn't it pretty?
2148;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Boyfriend;Talk;Yeah, sure.
2149;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Girlfriend;Talk;Hey. Aren't you listening?
2150;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Boyfriend;Talk;Oh, sorry. You're just so pretty I forgot everything else!
2151;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Girlfriend;Talk;You silly!
2152;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Boyfriend;Talk;Miitan!
2153;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Girlfriend;Talk;Takkun!
2154;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Boyfriend;Talk;Miitan!
2155;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;The observation deck!
2156;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Girlfriend;Talk;Takkun!
2157;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Let's go to the observation deck!
2158;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Look at that! The view from the observation deck is even more fabulous! We've really got to drink it all in!
2159;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I love air conditioning.
2160;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's heaven.
2161;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sure is.
2162;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Err, You guys?
2163;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Long, long ago, humans attempted to build a tower to heaven to prove themselves equal to God. God, enraged, scrambled the languages of humans, and cast their lands into chaos.
2164;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Talking about the Tower of Babel?
2165;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;B-But humans failed to learn and built another tall tower like this?
2166;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Guys! The scenery!
2167;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan got what she wanted, so let's blow this joint.
2168;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;G-Good idea.
2169;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;My favorite part was the air conditioning.
2170;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You filthy indoor types!
2171;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ryo. Weren't you eating sea salt soft-serve earlier?
2172;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I've always got room for ice cream.
2173;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;P-Please pay me back for the ice cream, too.
2174;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What should we do next?
2175;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I think we've had plenty of fun, don't you?
2176;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You think? I feel like we need one more memorable event...
2177;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I wanna eat shirasu-don, then! They were sold out at the place where we had lunch!
2178;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Nah. Too full.
2179;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Since when were you in charge?
2180;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;What's that sound?
2181;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, the kites?
2182;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;They like to steal human food, so—
2183;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Right as we were talking about it! You okay, Bocchi-chan?
2184;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, you want my ice cream?
2185;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;They're targeting Bocchi-chan!
2186;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Kite;Talk;She looks weak! It pisses me off. Teach her a lesson!
2187;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Even birds look down on her.
2188;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Even birds?! Gotoh-san, you okay?
2189;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's over.
2190;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Get lost!
2191;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Memorable event achieved.
2192;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That's not the kind of memorable I wanted!
2193;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But we can't stay out too late, so we really should head out. Bocchi's in bad shape, anyway.
2194;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Then how about a shrine visit before we head home?
2195;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;This shrine is dedicated to a goddess called Myo-on Benzaiten. She's the goddess of music and performing arts. I've always thought we should come here if we ever went to Enoshima together.
2196;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We'll have to wish for our band's future success!
2197;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan. You looked like you were wishing pretty hard back there.
2198;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It took forever.
2199;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What were you wishing for?
2200;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I was wishing and thanking her pretty hard too! Goddess, thanks for making our concert a success. Keep that good fortune coming!"
2201;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Really?
2202;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's get back to practice tomorrow! Even though we don't have a next concert scheduled!
2203;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I can't tell them... Please, Goddess! Turn back time to the first day of summer! I'll do anything, just turn back time! Either that, or give me fame and fortune so that I never go hungry! ...that I made a really vapid wish!
2204;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's about an hour from here to Shimo-Kita, right?
2205;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah. Gotoh-san, you'll change trains at Fujisawa, right?
2206;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yes.
2207;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Wake me up at Shimo-Kita.
2208;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, they're hopeless! I really wish we'd gotten to do some Kamakura sightseeing, and I wish we'd had dinner together, too!
2209;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Shirasu-don...
2210;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;She really wanted to eat that, huh?
2211;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;My first long trip in a while... That was lots of fun. I almost wish we could've stayed out a little longer.
2212;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay! Let's spend all of winter break hanging out as Kessoku Band! Where do you want to go, Gotoh-san? Let's make memories together every single day!
2213;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I d-don't wanna go outside every day!
2214;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I d-don't wanna go outside every day! I'll th-think about it...
2215;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Sure! You can rest if you want, Gotoh-san. I'll wake you up.
2216;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;A-Actually, I spent the whole train ride up here unconscious, so I'm pretty alert now.
2217;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Really? Then the fun continues until Fujisawa!
2218;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Hey... Kita-san? I e-enjoyed hanging out with you all today. I th-think I can face school starting tomorrow. Probably.
2219;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Really? I'm glad to hear it! Let's enjoy the new term together, too!
2220;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Sure.
2221;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sure. This memory of summer will fuel me through to winter break.
2222;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Hitori-chan! It's morning! I'm coming in! You're still in bed? You'll be late to school your first day back!
2223;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Don't feel good. Wanna stay home.
2224;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Oh, Hitori-chan. Lying again just to get out of school!
2225;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No...
2226;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Help me out, Futari!
2227;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;M-My muscles are so sore, I can't even move!
2228;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Futari Gotou;Talk;Okay! Wake up, Sis!
2229;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;No, no, no, no!
2230;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Morning!
2231;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Kita's Friends;Talk;Morning! Hey, Kita-chan, I saw your Issta photos of Enoshima!
2232;1;9;Enoshima Escar;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Really? Thanks!
2233;1;10;After Dark;Imaginary Staff;Imagination;Emergency! Emergency! The band we had scheduled can't perform! Are you kidding?! How will we find a replacement?
2234;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Perhaps I could be of some assistance?
2235;1;10;After Dark;Imaginary Staff;Imagination;Y-You're... I forget the name, but the girl from Class 2—
2236;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The name's Gotoh.
2237;1;10;After Dark;Crowd;Imagination;Gotoh-sama! Hold me! You're a living national treasure! Gotoh! Gotoh! Gotoh! Gotoh!
2238;1;10;After Dark;Culture Festival Planner;Talk;...six votes for a haunted house, and two votes for a candy shop.
2239;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;How long have I been out? I think I was in homeroom, and they started talking about festival project ideas... It's no use. Everything after the word unity came up is a blank.
2240;1;10;After Dark;Culture Festival Planner;Talk;Okay! So by majority vote, Class 2's project will be a maid and butler cafe! We'll have to get lots of maid uniforms!
2241;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;M-Maid?
2242;1;10;After Dark;Culture Festival Planner;Talk;Since all the girls'll be wearing them!
2243;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;All the girls?! Does that include... me? N-No way! Too far outside my skill set! Maybe if it was a grave cafe... A-Afterlife for two... Souvenirs from the grave available... Crud, that was close. I almost spaced out again.
2244;1;10;After Dark;Culture Festival Planner;Talk;And if anyone wants to perform on the second day of the culture festival, make sure you put one of these forms in the box in front of the student council room.
2245;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Perform on-stage as a band... I never got to do it in middle school. But I daydreamed about it a thousand times, so same thing, right? You feelin' the hype, arena? Besides, I play in real venues now! My band's not for fun and games! It's serious business!
2246;1;10;After Dark;Students;Talk;If someone from our class played, they'd be the coolest person ever! Totally!
2247;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;How'd I end up at the student council room?! What's this piece of paper? A band performance application... Kessoku Band... Who wrote all this?! What? Hitori Gotoh wrote it?! I'm a professional guitarist now! Begone, lust for culture festival attention! Focus on your band's career! Good... the lust is fading.
2248;1;10;After Dark;Student Council President;Talk;What was that? Teacher! Someone's collapsed out here!
2249;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;An unfamiliar ceiling.
2250;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, you're awake? How are you feeling?
2251;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'm f-fine.
2252;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I heard you collapsed, so I got worried.
2253;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sorry.
2254;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What's the matter?
2255;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-Nothing...
2256;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;N-Nothing... Wh-What do I do? If I tell Kita-san, she'll get all excited, eyes sparkling, and insist that we do it! I m-must avoid that!
2257;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-Nothing... Wh-What do I do? If I tell Kita-san, she'll get all excited, eyes sparkling, and insist that we do it! I m-must avoid that! Th-Thank you for coming. I-I'll head to work after a little more rest. D-Don't worry about me.
2258;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But won't you be lonely?
2259;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'll b-b-be fine! Y-You've got plans with friends today, right?
2260;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Sure, but I can cancel them!
2261;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'll b-b-be fine!
2262;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You're sure? Well, just take it easy, okay?
2263;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'd really like to perform, but I've barely done a real concert, so it's still really scary. Although... Now that I think about it, all the performers in a high school culture festival are amateurs. I wonder what the vibe is like...
2264;1;10;After Dark;Hipster Kid;Talk;Y'all What's up, y'all? Ready to feel the hype?! Yeah! We're We're gonna make one hell of a memory today! gonna make a memory today! Join me on this journey! me!!
2265;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Nope. I'm so worn out, I can't even watch the concert. But a loner-type shining at the culture festival is a classic trope! So maybe I can do it too?!
2266;1;10;After Dark;Culture Festival Announcer;Imagination;Next up, Kessoku Band performs! On drums, Nijika Ijichi from Shimo-Kitazawa High!
2267;1;10;After Dark;Crowd;Imagination;Wah!  Squee!  So pretty!  So cute!  Look at me!  Waaah!  Wahhh!
2268;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Imagination;Hi there!
2269;1;10;After Dark;Culture Festival Announcer;Imagination;And Ryo Yamada, from the same!
2270;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Imagination;Mini-bow.
2271;1;10;After Dark;Culture Festival Announcer;Imagination;And on lead guitar, from Class 2... Um... Oh, Gotoh-san! And on guitar and vocals, from Class 5, our school star, Kita-chan!
2272;1;10;After Dark;Crowd;Imagination;So cute!  Eee!  Squee!  Waaaaah!  Eee!  Eeee! Waaah!
2273;1;10;After Dark;Culture Festival Announcer;Imagination;It's Kita-chan!
2274;1;10;After Dark;Crowd;Imagination;We love you!
2275;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Imagination;Thanks, guys!
2276;1;10;After Dark;Crowd;Imagination;Kita-chan!                    Kita-chan!
2277;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The fervor gap is too intense! Yeah. Not happening. I gotta know my place.
2278;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Good morning, Manager.
2279;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Uh, could you do some work? If you're already on the fence, I think you should do it. These high school years will be gone before you know it.
2280;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yeah, maybe...
2281;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Not that I'd know, since I barely cared about high school.
2282;1;10;After Dark;PA-san;Talk;I dropped out!
2283;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I asked the wrong people.
2284;1;10;After Dark;PA-san;Talk;I could never drag myself out of bed in the morning!
2285;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Huh? Bocchi-chan's talking to Sis? That never happens.
2286;1;10;After Dark;PA-san;Talk;She's waffling about her culture festival.
2287;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Culture festival?
2288;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;She's trying to figure out if Kessoku Band should perform there.
2289;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Performing at a culture festival? Sounds awesome! Let's do it!
2290;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um... But...
2291;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's fun in a different way from performing at a club.
2292;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-You've done it before, Nijika-chan?
2293;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, in middle school.
2294;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Same. I played obscure songs and totally bombed with the audience!
2295;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Why do you sound proud of that?
2296;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I've never played with Ryo at a culture festival, though, so I'd love to play at this one!
2297;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Really?
2298;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well, we only recently formed Kessoku Band.
2299;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I'd like to play my original songs somewhere other than here, too.
2300;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Plus, it's a great chance to advertise ourselves!
2301;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;But... Don't you get expelled for playing something other than seishun rock at a high school culture festival?
2302;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Of course not!
2303;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I get why Bocchi's scared, though. There's a chance—a likelihood, rather—that you'll be playing in front of a large crowd. So you don't have to rush to a decision.
2304;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Ryo-san...
2305;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;To be honest, I still have nightmares about that concert I bombed.
2306;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;So you were just acting strong earlier?
2307;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Either way, just make sure you don't have any regrets, Bocchi-chan.
2308;1;10;After Dark;PA-san;Talk;Wise words.
2309;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;G-Got it. I'll think it over.
2310;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Right, right!
2311;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Nijika-chan wants to play at the culture festival too. I bet it'd feel pretty darn good... I... I just can't do it! I'm sorry, everyone. I thought I could do it yesterday, but I can't. B-But Nijika-chan told me to make sure I don't have any regrets, and if I blow it, I don't think I could make it through the rest of high school... I'm already nervous about playing in a club. The thought of being on stage at a festival... Yeah, just not happening.
2312;1;10;After Dark;Imaginary News;Imagination;Skyrocketing to fame! Let's look into the members of Kessoku Band! The unexpected past of super-popular guitarist Hitori Gotoh, whose cool personality, skillful playing, and raw lyrics have captured the hearts of fans! Hitori Gotoh Q. Did you know your high school classmate Hitori Gotoh has become a famous guitarist? Wow, Gotoh-san was in a band back then? I should've gotten her autograph!
2313;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'll just follow that model instead! I like it. Now that I've got a plan in mind, I don't feel so bad about it. Good work, me!
2314;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san! Morning!
2315;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;G-Good morning...
2316;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;How are you feeling? I got worried and stopped by the nurse's office again yesterday, but you were already gone.
2317;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Really? I'm sorry...
2318;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, and I turned it in. For the culture festival performance! We'll be on stage as Kessoku Band! I just can't wait! The application must've fallen in the trash can by mistake. What a close call, right? Let's put on the best culture festival concert ever!
2319;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So that's why she's been like that.
2320;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I was so sure she wanted to do it.
2321;1;10;After Dark;PA-san;Talk;She seemed very excited yesterday.
2322;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Wh-What do I do? I am a criminal.
2323;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Right?
2324;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;They're going to label me a murderer!
2325;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's not too late to back out, is it?
2326;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;They said you can't take it back once you've applied... But I'll talk to them tomorrow.
2327;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Hey-ho! Free booze, please!
2328;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Hell no. Piss off.
2329;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Aw, c'mon! Tell yer sister to be nicer! You like havin' me around, right, li'l sis?
2330;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kindly depart. We're about to open for business.
2331;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;You've got a death glare on par with Senpai's lately. Bocchi-chan! What's with her? Somethin' on her mind?
2332;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I volunteered us for the culture festival against her will.
2333;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;What? You gonna play there?
2334;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I c-can't do it. Th-There'd be so many more people than I'm used to, a-and I'm s-scared of performing in front of people who know me at s-school.
2335;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Bocchi-chan. For you! Payin' you back for before. My band's playin' a gig tonight! Wanna come see?
2336;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Can I?
2337;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;'Course you can! Same goes for all y'all.
2338;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Thank you very much.
2339;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let me pay you.
2340;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yes, for the tickets.
2341;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Aw, don't go there. It's a gift!
2342;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;But...
2343;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Please, let us pay!
2344;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;H-Hang on, do you think I'm some kind of broke rocker who's gotta hustle money from teenage girls?
2345;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You mean you're not?
2346;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Damn it! Senpai, one bottle of shochu!
2347;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Like hell, dumbass.
2348;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Anyhoo, it's fine! I might not look it, but our band's pretty popular on the indies circuit! Right?
2349;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yes, they have many hardcore fans.
2350;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Which means we make our ticket quotas, easy! We even make money on merch!
2351;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Then why do you only drink the cheap stuff? And you use our shower, too.
2352;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Pay rent.
2353;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;You never paid me back for your train fare.
2354;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Sounds like a hustle to me!
2355;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Th-There's a reason for all this... All my money goes to paying for the equipment I break while playing drunk.
2356;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;So it's your own fault. Bocchi-chan, has she borrowed any more money from you that she hasn't paid back?
2357;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-No... she hasn't...
2358;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Garbage humans. Apologize for your late repayment.
2359;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Sorry for our lateness!
2360;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Sorry for our lateness!
2361;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-It's okay...
2362;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Noguchi-sensei... farewell...
2363;1;10;After Dark;Seika Ijichi;Talk;You really need to cut back. You never used to drink before you started playing concerts. It can't be good for you.
2364;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;C'mon, that's no biggie! Now, let's all go to Shinjuku! I can't hear you!
2365;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Do you think she can really play like that?
2366;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;You're supposed to say "go!"
2367;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Getting to see SICK HACK for free... My soul is on fire!
2368;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;SICK HACK? Is that the name of Hiroi-san's band?
2369;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Yep!
2370;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I knew she was good from our street concert... But I don't really know what she sounds like. I'm kind of looking forward to this!
2371;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I v-very much enjoyed the concert... Thank you for having me...
2372;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We're not even at the venue yet!
2373;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Here's my home base, Shinjuku FOLT!
2374;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;C'mon in, y'all!
2375;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;The vibe is very different from Starry's...
2376;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, no worries. It's the same kind of place.
2377;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It is a little scary, but I feel strangely confident. Clubs are the same wherever you—
2378;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It is a little scary, but I feel strangely confident. Clubs are the same wherever you— Th-Thank you for the wonderful concert!
2379;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Seriously, it hasn't started yet!
2380;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I w-was a fool to think I'd grown as a person...
2381;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I'm sure they're nice people if you talk to them!
2382;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Gin-chan! Mornin'!
2383;1;10;After Dark;Ginjiro Yoshida;Talk;Yeah?
2384;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I m-miss my sister!
2385;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It's gotten to Ijichi-senpai too!
2386;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;This is the manager, Gin-chan!
2387;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;H-Hello!
2388;1;10;After Dark;Ginjiro Yoshida;Talk;Oh, gosh, look at all the cute little buddies you brought! I'm Ginjiro Yoshida, 37 years old! Punk rock's my genre of choice!
2389;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;The contrast between how he looks and talks kinda shorts out your brain, right? But don't worry. Gin-chan's a nice old guy with the heart of a pure maiden!
2390;1;10;After Dark;Shima Iwashita;Talk;Hey, Hiroi.
2391;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Yeah?
2392;1;10;After Dark;Shima Iwashita;Talk;For the millionth time, don't be late.
2393;1;10;After Dark;Eliza Shimizu;Talk;Our rehearsal's already over!
2394;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Sorry! But it'll all work out, I bet!
2395;1;10;After Dark;Shima Iwashita;Talk;Are these the members of Kessoku Band?
2396;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Y-Yes! And you're...
2397;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;She's part of SICK HACK.
2398;1;10;After Dark;Shima Iwashita;Talk;I'm Shima, the drummer. A pleasure.
2399;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's such a pleasure to meet you!
2400;1;10;After Dark;Shima Iwashita;Talk;I'm sure our Hiroi's caused a lot of trouble for you. If this will in any way make up for it...
2401;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Sh-She's so polite!
2402;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, th-thank you!
2403;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Maybe the other band members balance her out?
2404;1;10;After Dark;Eliza Shimizu;Talk;I'm Eliza! I lived in England until I was eighteen. This is my third year in Japan. Let's be friends!
2405;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You came all the way to Japan to be in a band? Do you like J-Rock?
2406;1;10;After Dark;Eliza Shimizu;Talk;No. Actually, I came to Japan for Comiket! I really wanna be in an anisong cover band!
2407;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Eliza's always saying anisongs are Japan's real bleeding-edge sound!
2408;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The three of them are... Balanced?
2409;1;10;After Dark;Eliza Shimizu;Talk;I bought this in Asakusa!
2410;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Nice one!
2411;1;10;After Dark;Shima Iwashita;Talk;Stop now.
2412;1;10;After Dark;Bartender;Talk;Here you are.
2413;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thank you! Look at all the people!
2414;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;There's at least two hundred here.
2415;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I had no idea her band was this popular...
2416;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;By the way, where's Ryo?
2417;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;She was with us just minutes ago... Eh? She's sitting over there!
2418;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sh-She's doing... the club classic: the "I'm not like you overexcited sheeple" customer!
2419;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Take in the sound. The sound!
2420;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ryo-senpai. What kind of band is SICK HACK, exactly?
2421;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;They play psychedelic rock. A genre that spread in the 1960s as a musical expression of drug-induced hallucinations whose influence led to many progressive rock bands getting their start...
2422;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I've never seen Senpai talk so much about anything.
2423;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I c-can't wait to hear them.
2424;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah! I'm kinda interested in psychedelic rock!
2425;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Really? I'll bring all my albums tomorrow. It's best for a beginner to start from the second.
2426;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Better watch what you say, Kita-chan. That kind of line will get you mobbed by fanatics.
2427;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Their band's amazing. The drum's spot-on irregular time signature that keeps you off-balance. The emotional yet overwhelmingly logical playing of the guitar... And the bass forms a wall of sound that supports it all. But the most amazing thing of all... is her overwhelming charisma! For the time they're standing on stage, performers are heroes! A band really is the coolest thing ever!
2428;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! How'd you like my show?
2429;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-It was great.
2430;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Hey, what's got you so down? We stunk the place up after all?
2431;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;N-Not at all. You really were incredible. But I... er... You were really shining up there. I don't think I could... ever...
2432;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Lemme fill you in here. Up to high school, I was the gloomy misfit sittin' in a corner of the classroom. Could ya tell? I guess it's true what they say: gloomy people attract. But sometimes I'd imagine what my future was gonna look like, and I'd think, "C'mon, that's lame!" I started playing rock to make my life's course do a 180. At first, I was scared stiff of buying a bass at the music shop or going into a club. The whole reason I started drinking was to chill myself out before our first concert. Everyone's scared when they do something for the first time. But you played just fine, both on the street and at Starry! And you didn't even need alcohol to do it!
2433;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;You mean...
2434;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Have a little faith in yourself! And if that's not enough, have a drink to take the edge off!
2435;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I-I'm really too young. But I'd like you to come to our culture festival performance.
2436;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Yeah, that's the way!
2437;1;10;After Dark;Ginjiro Yoshida;Talk;I'm adding 100,000 to your tab for wall repairs.
2438;1;10;After Dark;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Th-That one's partly Bocchi-chan's fault!
2439;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Okay! Now that the concert's got us all hyped up, let's plot our culture festival setlist! Kita-chan said each band gets fifteen minutes. So that's about three songs, right?
2440;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;H-Hey... C-Can't I let Ryo-senpai have some of mine?
2441;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No! She needs to learn her lesson for bumming off of Bocchi-chan for so long.
2442;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Ikuyo...
2443;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan! Don't fall for our wicked bandmate's tricks! The three Bs to avoid in a boyfriend are bassist, bassist, and bassist, after all!
2444;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I'll never borrow money from anyone again.
2445;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Then I gift you this.
2446;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You're kind, Nijika. I love you.
2447;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;The legit gratitude is tugging on my heartstrings, darn it! Just help yourself already!
2448;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I already know our setlist. I've been thinking it over since the culture festival came up.
2449;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nice!
2450;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We'll put a Bocchi guitar solo in the second one. To make sure you shine. It's your and Ikuyo's culture festival, remember?
2451;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But isn't going all-original in the culture festival a bit aggressive?
2452;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So what? Let's be aggressive!
2453;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;And if we bomb, there's four of us. We can split the shame four ways.
2454;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ryo, are you trying to push your trauma on the rest of us?
2455;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Guitar solo...
2456;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;K-Kita-san?
2457;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;G-Gotoh-san... I... I knew you'd thrown out the culture festival application! But I submitted it anyway. I'm so, so sorry that I lied!
2458;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-Thank you for doing it. I w-was pretty freaked out at first, but now I'm kind of looking forward to it. Th-That wouldn't have happened if you hadn't turned in the application. So I'm really grateful. Thank you.
2459;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, I'm going to work even harder at practice than ever! So let's make our culture festival concert a success!
2460;1;10;After Dark;Hitori Gotou;Talk;O-Okay.
2461;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;The truth is, I really wanted Gotoh-san to perform at the culture festival. Because Gotoh-san is...
2462;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ryo-senpai! Would you be willing to coach me on guitar after work?
2463;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Isn't Bocchi coaching you?
2464;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san has her own practice to focus on. I want to practice and get better too!
2465;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You heard her. Humor her, okay?
2466;1;10;After Dark;Ryo Yamada;Talk;My lessons don't come cheap.
2467;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay!
2468;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;How come Bocchi-chan's not with you today?
2469;1;10;After Dark;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Well... she's got make-up lessons...
2470;1;10;After Dark;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan's missing?!
2471;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Crowd;Talk;Anyone want a hot dog? Churros!! Class 2-2's doing a haunted house!
2472;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Boy, even the first day is a total event! Not at all like our school!
2473;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Hey, where do you wanna start? Dunno... I'd love to try Class 2's haunted house! Awesome! Let's do it!
2474;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;It's like an entire school of Ikuyos.
2475;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well, anyway... I think Bocchi-chan's class is nearby, so let's check that out!
2476;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, bet this's it! Hi-ho! Is Bocchi-chan in?
2477;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Serve us, Bocchi.
2478;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Senpai...
2479;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan! Did you come to see Bocchi-chan in her maid costume too?
2480;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Where's the Bocchi-chan maid?
2481;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;About that...
2482;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What?! Bocchi-chan vanished?!
2483;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;She put on her maid costume and said she was going to the bathroom. We haven't seen her since. I wish she could've just told us if she didn't want to do it.
2484;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You'd think running around the school as a maid would be even more embarrassing... But whatever. Let's get searching!
2485;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Right!
2486;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No whining, you!
2487;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No Bocchi-chan here... Where could she have gone? Maybe we should check all the women's bathrooms?
2488;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;All of them?
2489;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;No... Gotoh-san won't be found in such a constantly inhabited location!
2490;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Aha! Where should we look, then? Teach us, Professor Kita!
2491;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Allow me to elucidate! It must be uninhabited! It must be damp and depressing. We must search the kinds of ecosystems in which one might find slugs. She might be found beneath a rock, perchance!
2492;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Effortlessly brutal.
2493;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I lied and ran off without thinking about it. I'm gonna make trouble for everyone if I don't get back. But I'll die from embarrassment if my band sees me like this. If only I had my ripe mangos... Welcome home! I long for the warmth of that cardboard box... It's no use. I'm gonna drive myself crazy like this. I need escapism. Let's retreat to the online world. I've been so busy with rehearsals, I haven't looked in ages... My comments section is the nicest place in the world. Every single comment is kind and— C-C-Crud! I-If I don't upload a video, my home... I'll lose my online home!
2494;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;H-Huh? When was the last time I uploaded again? I've been so busy, I haven't even had time to think about it... I'll put something up the minute the culture festival's over!
2495;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, there she is!
2496;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, your whole class is worried about you!
2497;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;In a place you'd find slugs... You called it.
2498;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I feel justified in rummaging through those trash cans and cisterns!
2499;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Though it sorta stopped feeling like we were looking for a person... Anyway, come on back, would you?
2500;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;'Kay...
2501;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, look! Right here! Kessoku Band It's got our name on it! But of course it does, right?
2502;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Seeing Kessoku Band's name in our school does feel odd, doesn't it?
2503;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah.
2504;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Don't get too worked up now. You'll just exhaust yourself.
2505;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;R-Right! Let's take the day to just enjoy the culture festival! Right, Gotoh-san?
2506;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Unlike Kita-chan, I've never actually enjoyed a school event...
2507;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Crowd;Talk;Line for the Class 2-2 haunted house ends here! One person incoming!
2508;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I've been really curious about this! You think we can take a little detour?
2509;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'd like to try it too! It's getting great reviews!
2510;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Can we take another detour?
2511;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;One chocolate crêpe!
2512;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Chocolate banana? Or should I go with something more tart?
2513;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Buy both, and give me some.
2514;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You bet!
2515;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, no casual extortion.
2516;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Is that Bocchi-chan?! Here we go... Gotcha!
2517;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Congratulations!
2518;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah!
2519;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Nice work, Senpai!
2520;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Eh? It's almost like... Doing the culture festival as a group is actually pretty fun.
2521;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Easy-peasy!
2522;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Thanks for winning that for me.
2523;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;It's not for you.
2524;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;And...
2525;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;And... Wh-Where to next?
2526;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Good enthusiasm! Let's keep going until we do the full circuit!
2527;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I think you're having too much fun! And Gotoh-san has this... The longer we mess around out here, the later I get back to the maid cafe!" ...look on her face!
2528;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;B-Busted!
2529;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Welcome to Class 1-2's maid cafe! Welcome home! Sit right here!
2530;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san's class really went all-out!
2531;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;They all look so cute!
2532;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;And Gotoh-san's doing a great job standing up straight and looking customers in the eye!
2533;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I guess working for us really helped her out, huh?
2534;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;No! She's just passed out on her feet.
2535;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You're right!
2536;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Not good. A gang of post-apocalyptic hooligans...
2537;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Who let them into the school?!
2538;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Post-Apocalypse Hooligan;Talk;Hey, babe. How's about you drop the sign and have a little fun with us?! My charge didn't even faze her! She's even got the confidence to make faces at us! She's somethin' else! Forgive us for our arrogance!
2539;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san's amazing! She's being so helpful!
2540;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Y-Yeah... I guess.
2541;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan, we're ready to order!
2542;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wh-Wh-What can I get you?!
2543;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's see... Hey... Anyone else notice how good Bocchi-chan looks in that maid outfit?
2544;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You look so good in frilly stuff, Gotoh-san!
2545;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Yeah, totes! I wish you wouldn't wear that tracksuit all the time.
2546;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;W-Well, I... Wh-What is it?
2547;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Some bands do push the visual aspect... I never knew you were such an uncut gem!
2548;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Ryo-san?
2549;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We'll have you in a swimsuit in the video. For modern bands, it's views that do the talking! And bringing in those views requires a few sacrifices here and there!
2550;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;No, no, no, no, no, no!
2551;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;We'll wrap you in black tape and have you play on the ocean!
2552;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Stop using Bocchi-chan as a cash cow!
2553;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;P-Please just order!
2554;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, right...
2555;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Can someone spot me?
2556;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Wow, it looks delicious!
2557;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;How about this? What's the Sure-Pure Melt-in-Your-Mouth Magic Omurice?
2558;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's just normal omurice.
2559;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;And the Unicorn Fantasy Dream Sparkle-Shine Omurice?
2560;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;That's also normal omurice.
2561;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;And the Lie-4-U Die-4-U Sickly-Chic Omurice?
2562;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;It's... normal omurice.
2563;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;So it's all the same thing with different names?!
2564;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;We spent all our budget on the costumes.
2565;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;O-One Sure-Pure M-Melt-in-Your-Mouth Magic Omurice...
2566;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Excuse me! I'd like one of these deliciousness spells, if you please!
2567;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, w-well...
2568;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;The customer's always right. Smirk, smirk. Smirk, smirk.
2569;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Help us out, Miss Maid!
2570;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Smirk, smirk. Smirk, smirk.
2571;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You guys are really enjoying this...
2572;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Sure-sure pure-pure miracle squee omurice... Become delicious.
2573;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Kind of grainy.
2574;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yeah, we bought them frozen...
2575;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san! You need to put more love into the spell! Watch me work! Just like this! Sure-sure! Pure-pure! Miracle... Squee! If you please, omurice... Become delicious!
2576;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;Gotoh-san! You need to put more love into the spell! Watch me work! Just like this! Sure-sure! Pure-pure! Miracle... Squee! If you please, omurice... Become delicious! Kit-aura
2577;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;The acidity of the ketchup and sweetness of the sauce blend together, giving it the soul-warming feel of home cooking!
2578;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Smooth!
2579;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Kita-chan! Would you mind helping our class out?
2580;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Could I?! I'd love to wear the costume!
2581;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;How do I look?
2582;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Kita-chan, you look so good!
2583;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You're wearing the heck out of that thing!
2584;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Would you guys like to wear one, too? For the memory!
2585;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What? Can we?
2586;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Of course you can! Crazy cute! Crazy cute!
2587;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hold it! Let's have Senpai in "big sister" style! Or... What about boy style?! A fabulous choice, if I do say so myself!
2588;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Isn't she getting a bit too excited compared to with me?
2589;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;But the three of you together make such a powerful visual! Would you be willing to help us out a while?
2590;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;No prob! I already work in customer service, so I got this handled!
2591;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Thank you! Thank you!
2592;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Welcome home!
2593;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Welcome home!
2594;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What bands are you here to see today?
2595;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ijichi-senpai, this is a maid cafe!
2596;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ah, I slipped into my usual work persona!
2597;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Incredible. Kita-san and Nijika-chan have such overwhelming adaptability and customer service powers!
2598;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Post-Apocalypse Hooligan;Talk;'Scuse me! Could I have s'more water?
2599;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Ryo-senpai, you take care of them!
2600;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Heh. You want it? Come get it.
2601;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Post-Apocalypse Hooligan;Talk;F-F-Forgive us for our arrogance!
2602;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;This isn't the club! Still hot, though!
2603;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;R-Ryo has her own inexplicable power, too...
2604;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Post-Apocalypse Hooligan;Talk;Thanks! Y-Y-Yeah!
2605;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey! I brought a group!
2606;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Uh-oh!
2607;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Welcome home! Come right this way!
2608;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Culture Festival Planner;Talk;Gotoh-san, you can take a break!
2609;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;S-Sure...
2610;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;S-Sure... This difference in reception... It feels like a preview of tomorrow's concert!
2611;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Awesome! We're sold out of omurice already!
2612;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Culture Festival Planner;Talk;I bet we take first place in the class sales rankings!
2613;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;We owe it to Kita-chan and the rest of your band! Thank you so much!
2614;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Hey, it's no biggie! We had fun too! Thanks!
2615;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Culture Festival Planner;Talk;We'll totally come to watch your concert tomorrow!
2616;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Awesome! Please do!
2617;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;And what about our fee? Don't tell me you expected us to work for free...
2618;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;C'mon! We gotta go practice!
2619;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Waaaagh...
2620;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;But first, could we do one thing?
2621;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I wanted to get a look at our venue before we left!
2622;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Wow, what a pretty gym!
2623;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;The max occupancy must be around a thousand.
2624;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I doubt we'll get that many people, of course... But I sure hope we get a lot!
2625;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah...
2626;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You bet we will! We've got Kita-chan power on our side!
2627;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right...
2628;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;R-Right... I'll be standing up there tomorrow... Together with Kessoku Band!
2629;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I've been thinking, Bocchi-chan... Your guitar's pretty old, isn't it?
2630;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I noticed that too! The frets are rusty, plus the hairline cracks... It's a well-used vintage item, right? It could sell for quite a lot—
2631;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Stop putting a price on everything.
2632;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um, I'm borrowing the one my dad used when he was younger... So I guess it is pretty old.
2633;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;He's coming with your family tomorrow, right?
2634;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah... He couldn't make it to our concert because of the storm, but he was pretty excited. He even bought a camcorder!
2635;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Vibes in the house!
2636;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I can totally imagine it!
2637;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;My friends sent me a LOINE message about how much they're looking forward to it!
2638;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;All the more reason to give it our best!
2639;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah, guess so!
2640;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Oh, right... What kind of MCing should I do for tomorrow's concert?
2641;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Introduce us, the songs, and add a little commentary, I guess?
2642;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Th-That sounds good to me.
2643;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well, what we do now is fine... But I thought a little funny MCing like popular bands do might be fun.
2644;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Band MCing is never funny. Fans just laugh along to humor them. Opinions expressed are solely Yamada's
2645;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Way too harsh!
2646;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Once we get popular, even your lousiest MCing will pick up big laughs. Don't worry.
2647;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Is that a reassurance or a diss?!
2648;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Break-up imminent!
2649;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Now, now! No fighting! Let's finish our practice!
2650;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Right, sorry. Let's do it! Okay, here we go!
2651;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Sounds great!
2652;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Huh?
2653;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Yeah.
2654;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;That was wonderful!
2655;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Kita-san's kind of...
2656;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What's the matter, Gotoh-san?
2657;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Oh, I thought... I just really hope people enjoy our concert!
2658;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Yeah, I know they will!
2659;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;That's good. Be confident.
2660;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;We're counting on you, Bocchi-chan!
2661;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We all need to have self-confidence. I think you'll knock everyone's socks off!
2662;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Oh, I doubt that...
2663;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You totally will! Because you're so amazingly... No... Never mind. Let's just do our best!
2664;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
2665;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Well, that's all for today! In preparation for tomorrow, let's all get to bed early! Right!
2666;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Good work today, all!
2667;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;It's got that autumn feeling, huh?
2668;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I figured we'd be working on our first mini-album by now.
2669;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We're making steady progress. That's all that matters!
2670;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's almost here. The festival performance. My first performance in front of the school. I can't be as confident as Kita-san is. But I do hope they enjoy us!
2671;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;My sister said she'd be here too!
2672;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Wow, really?
2673;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Okay, girl. Have faith in yourself! Trust that it's all going to go right. What if... What if a record company producer is in the audience?
2674;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Guitar man;Talk;Magnifique! You deserve a debut contract!
2675;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The success story of a high school band... Maybe it'll make the news, and we'll become a legend!
2676;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Back in her own little world, huh?
2677;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Time to go, Bocchi-chan!
2678;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;C-Coming!
2679;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;They're loving the band before us, huh?
2680;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;They're playing a big hit song from this year.
2681;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Who waves glowsticks at a rock concert?
2682;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm so nervous now!
2683;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Kita-chan! Deep breaths! Bocchi-chan! You okay?
2684;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Yes!
2685;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Six months ago she had to wear the mango box, and now she's facing it head-on!
2686;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Why's this band's drummer so loud?
2687;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san, you breathe too! Deep breath in... Deep breath out. Deep breath in... Deep breath out.
2688;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Culture Festival Announcer;Talk;Kessoku Band! You're up soon!
2689;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Right! Okay! Wanna do a huddle? Oh! Or that thing where we put our hands together and go "Yeah!"
2690;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I love it! Let's do it!
2691;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ryo Yamada;Talk;So stuffy.
2692;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Left hands, all!
2693;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay!
2694;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Just do it already!
2695;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You too, Gotoh-san!
2696;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right.
2697;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Now, let's play hard and have fun! One, two...
2698;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Culture Festival Announcer;Talk;Our next band is Kessoku Band!
2699;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Kita's Friends;Talk;Kita-chan! Kita-chan! Kita-chan!
2700;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hi!
2701;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's just what I expected.
2702;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Futari Gotou;Talk;Big Sis! Give it your best!
2703;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;Hitori-chan!
2704;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;M-My fans!
2705;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Bocchi's Fans;Talk;Give it your best!
2706;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;People from my class, too... It's not just what I expected!
2707;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Hey! Kick ass up there, Bocchi-chan! Hey, look! 'Cuz today's special, I'm drinkin' the kind that comes in glasses! Gimme a good show, 'kay?!
2708;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Students;Talk;Reeks of booze! I'm not sure she should be here...
2709;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Huh? Whu? Don't ignore me, Bocchi-chan! It's me, Big Sister Kikuri!
2710;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I shouldn't have invited her!
2711;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Get it together, loser!
2712;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;S-Senpai... Uncle, uncle!
2713;1;11;Duodecimal Sunset;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We're Kessoku Band, and we mainly play outside of school. We hope our performance helps make today more memorable for everyone. And if you're interested, we hope you'll come to see us at our club! Here comes our first song... as Kessoku Band!
2714;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thank you! That was our first song, I Will Never Forget!
2715;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I can't believe how enthusiastic they are. But...
2716;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Kita's Friends;Talk;Kita-chan! You were so cute!
2717;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Now, before we play our next song... Let's have a few words from Kessoku Band's leader: our drummer and my senpai, Nijika Ijichi!
2718;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Seika Ijichi;Talk;They've worked pretty hard.
2719;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Yeah... But Bocchi-chan...
2720;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Our esteemed bassist, Ryo Yamada, told me that any MCing I did for Kessoku Band would be a flop, and at first I thought, "How dare you!" But until I learn to be entertaining with this stuff, I figured I'd stick to concert announcements! Of course, I don't actually know when our next concert'll be... But if you wanna see more, just hit up our vocalist, Kita-chan,
2721;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Kita's Friends;Talk;Kita-chan!
2722;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Crowd;Talk;Hitori-chan!
2723;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Nice to meet you, everyone! Are you having a good time?! or our guitarist, Bo— Hitori Gotoh, when you can! Anyway, let's move on to the next song!
2724;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Right! Please lend us your ears! Our next song is To Become a Constellation...!
2725;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Yeah, something's not right. It's been fine this whole time, but now I can't get the E string in tune... The E string! Not good... But if I can at least get the B string in tune... The peg's broken!
2726;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Kikuri Hiroi;Inner Voice;She can't use the B string now. She won't be able to do her solo.
2727;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What'll I do? My solo's coming up... If our big culture festival performance fails because I had equipment trouble... What do I do? What do I do, what do I do, what do I do, what do I do?! Kita-san... She's ad-libbing completely on the fly!
2728;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Inner Voice;I'm going to make sure everyone can see... how amazingly cool Gotoh-san really is!
2729;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Crowd;Talk;What's their guitarist doing? Dunno, but it's pretty awesome!
2730;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Who whips out the bottleneck playing at a time like this?
2731;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Now it won't matter if she's a little out of tune!
2732;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Well... I wasn't going to say anything before our last song, but please let me say one thing! Thanks so much for having us today! We're gonna try our best to become so good, that one day you'll brag about having seen us here!
2733;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Crowd;Talk;Awesome! Budokan-bound! You were great, Whatever-san! You did good even when your string broke!
2734;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, Gotoh-san! Looks like you've gotta say something!
2735;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;P-People with social anxiety can't talk without a pre-arranged script! If you put me in this unplanned situation... Say something funny. Something funny. Something... Something... funny...
2736;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Gotoh-san? Gotoh-san?!
2737;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You okay, Bocchi-chan?!
2738;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Crowd;Talk;Someone call a teacher!
2739;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You're a legendary rock star!
2740;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;Bocchi-chan rocks!
2741;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Seika Ijichi;Talk;At least show a little concern!
2742;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Seriously!
2743;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Crowd;Talk;Someone bring a stretcher!
2744;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Hitori! You okay?!
2745;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Futari Gotou;Talk;I'm sorry about my sister.
2746;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;H-Hey, it's fine!
2747;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;It's all over.
2748;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Are you all right, Gotoh-san? Are you conscious?
2749;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Y-Yeah...
2750;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Thank goodness. Looks like it wasn't too bad.
2751;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um... I'm really sorry I ruined everything. After all you did...
2752;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Actually, I think people liked it even more.
2753;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um... Where are the others?
2754;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;They're cleaning up now. They said we'd have an after-party if you were feeling well enough. But if you aren't, we can save it for later.
2755;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right... Oh, that was a surprise. Kita-san. You got so good so fast.
2756;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Only for rhythm, of course.
2757;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um...
2758;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I can't do the kind of playing that really draws people in. But I seem to be pretty good at the give-and-take with you guys. I'm gonna keep working on my playing, so please keep teaching me. Gotoh-sa— Hitori-chan.
2759;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right!
2760;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Okay, I'm off! Come by when you're ready!
2761;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right...
2762;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;I'm going to become good enough to support Hitori-chan.
2763;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Speaker Voice;Talk;Culture Festival will now come to an end.
2764;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Kikuri Hiroi;Talk;After-party! After-party!
2765;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I hope Bocchi-chan's okay...
2766;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Students;Talk;Hey, it's the stage diver. Oh, the crazy rocker chick?
2767;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Some day... Some day, I will quit high school!
2768;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Forgive me, Father!
2769;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Futari Gotou;Talk;What're you doing, Sis?
2770;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I broke the guitar Dad lent me while we were playing!
2771;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;P-Please, get up! I'm really not mad! Please? It's just a broken peg, right? It's really not that big a deal.
2772;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;But...
2773;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Plus, it was pretty rad the way you broke it in the middle of the concert! Nowadays, they sell guitars designed to break. You should use one of those in your next gig!
2774;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;What kind of daughter are you trying to raise?
2775;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Anyway, this is probably a good opportunity for you to buy your own guitar.
2776;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Futari Gotou;Talk;Play with me, Dad! C'mon, Dad!
2777;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;What a good idea!
2778;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;That way, if you hit an issue like this again, you can deal with it right away.
2779;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;But... Even though I do have a job, all the money goes to my quotas. I can't afford...
2780;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;No worries! You've got money!
2781;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Wh-Where'd it all come from? Dad, are you involved in some shady dealings?!
2782;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Wh-Where'd it all come from? Dad, are you involved in some shady dealings?! I c-can't accept your dirty money!
2783;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;We're not that badly off!
2784;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;That's money you earned from advertisements on your videos.
2785;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;See, if a video gets enough views, they pay you. Did you forget the video site account you use is a family account?
2786;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;You mean, my videos...
2787;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;We know all about 'em! guitarhero, right? They've been racking up the views, so I monetized 'em in secret. How'd my girl get so good?! I figured you'd need the money eventually. And it's been amazing to see you work so hard and get better and better at the guitar. Right, dear?
2788;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Michiyo Gotou;Talk;Yes. I don't know much about music, but I do think you're amazing at it!
2789;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Dad... Mom...
2790;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Naoki Gotou;Talk;Of course, it's balanced out by my sadness at seeing you get better and better at lying...
2791;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Barf!
2792;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;There's 300,000 yen here. I never imagined getting such a windfall. If I buy a guitar that costs 100k, I'll have 200k left... And if I put that all to quota costs, I could play for almost two years without having to work a normal job! Yes! I'm totally quitting!
2793;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan's been unusually chipper today.
2794;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;And she bows at me every time we make eye contact.
2795;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;The thought of quitting my job fills me with a mysterious and overwhelming power! Time to talk to the manager now!
2796;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ultra super Bocchi-chan?
2797;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Seika Ijichi;Talk;What's this about your job?
2798;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... W-Well... S-See... I'll continue to work my hardest and most earnestly at it.
2799;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Seika Ijichi;Talk;What's with the sudden declaration of commitment?
2800;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;There's nothing harder than declaring you're gonna quit a job. Maybe I should ghost them... But they do know where I li— Uh, I mean, I don't want to put them out...
2801;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan! You're going to the music shop today, right?
2802;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Maybe if I buy an instrument for the manager, she'll let me quit! I've got lots of money now, after all!
2803;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan?
2804;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;H-Hey... Could you ask the manager if there's anything she wants?
2805;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan asked that. Since your birthday's coming up, maybe she's talking about a present?
2806;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Seika Ijichi;Talk;I don't want anything.
2807;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;She says no thanks!
2808;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;I'm finished.
2809;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Bocchi. I'd like a Dingwall and new Le Fay headless and a Darkglass amp head.
2810;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;We're heading to the music shop, everyone!
2811;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's la go!
2812;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Seika Ijichi;Talk;Bocchi-chan's really nice.
2813;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;PA-san;Talk;Have fun!
2814;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Seika Ijichi;Talk;But I prefer my presents to be a surprise.
2815;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;If you wanna buy an instrument, you gotta go to Ochanomizu!
2816;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, Hitori-chan! Do you know why there are so many music shops here?
2817;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Well, you see... The music business flourished here due to it playing host in the Meiji Period to Japan's oldest professional orchestra, leading to the formation of now-legacy stores in Ochanomizu like Shimokura Music, Ishibashi Music, and etc etc, blah blah, yada yada...
2818;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;I bet we'll be seeing a lot of this today.
2819;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's go in here! It's got a great selection!
2820;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I'd really rather not. I was gonna just buy one online, but...
2821;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Ordering online is fine and all, but you really oughta handle a guitar before you buy it!
2822;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;R-Right...
2823;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;R-Right... Music store owners are scary, and if one were to start talking to me...
2824;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Imaginary Music Store Owner;Imagination;You like that guitar? You got good taste, dearie. You like Western music? Wait, you don't?! Time to die!
2825;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;If I put on headphones like I'm listening to music, maybe no one will talk to me!
2826;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Clerk;Talk;M-Manager! A major headbanger has entered the store!
2827;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Manager;Talk;Must be a hardcore metal fan!
2828;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Clerk;Talk;Ma'am! The heavy metal guitars are on the second floor!
2829;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;What a cute strap!
2830;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;This color would look great with your guitar, Kita-chan!
2831;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Look at all the kinds of picks! Maybe I'll turn some into earrings!
2832;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;What a great idea!
2833;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Clerk;Talk;What's the matter, ma'am? Ma'am?
2834;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Can we stop by a hobby shop after this? Plus, I checked in advance and found out there's a nice café nearby!
2835;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Clerk;Talk;Ma'am?!
2836;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Look at the damn instruments.
2837;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Excuse me. Can I try out this bass?
2838;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Clerk;Talk;Go ahead.
2839;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;You're buying another, Senpai?
2840;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;No. I just like how it looks, so I'd like to play it a bit. Ah, is slapping okay?
2841;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Clerk;Talk;Yes, that's fine.
2842;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Like this.
2843;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Is she going to do that?
2844;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;Amazing. I didn't even go that hard. What a great bass!
2845;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;When you go all-out but act smug about it!
2846;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;Not that I mind.
2847;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;What is it, Ikuyo? You like that guitar?
2848;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;No, it's not like that... I've still got the guitar you lent me, after all!
2849;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;You can never have too many guitars.
2850;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;They're all having so much fun. Is this the lonely drummer thing I see in manga all the time? M-Maybe I'll buy a guitar and a bass myself! Just to play, darn it!
2851;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ryo Yamada;Talk;I see. Were you feeling lonely?
2852;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;Let's hit up a drum shop next time! There's one in Akiba.
2853;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Inner Voice;This one's cool...
2854;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Manager;Talk;Yamaha's pretty great, huh? That one's custom-made, too. It's a really great guitar, especially for the price! Would you like to try it out?
2855;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;Um... Um...
2856;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Manager;Talk;If it's your first guitar, you might want shielding and a mini amp!
2857;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Hitori Gotou;Talk;I... I'll take the lot.
2858;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Nijika Ijichi;Talk;You already have that stuff, Bocchi-chan!
2859;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Manager;Talk;Oh, you already play? I'm so sorry!
2860;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Hey, that's okay. Her guitar broke recently, so she's looking for a replacement. Right, Hitori-chan?
2861;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Music Store Manager;Talk;Lots of people have multiples nowadays. Even students!
2862;1;12;Morning Light Falls on You;Ikuyo Kita;Talk;Oh, really? You like this guitar, Hitori-chan? Right. Right. She'll take this guitar, please! Right, Hitori-chan?
